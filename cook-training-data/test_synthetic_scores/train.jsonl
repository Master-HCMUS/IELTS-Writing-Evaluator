Additionally, influential personalities such as popular actors and artists are normalizing this trend by enhancing their on-screen appearances and giving a youthful appeal to their admirers. To illustrate further, a survey has been conducted by United Nations Educational, Science and Cultural Organization, indicating 65 per cent of the adults are willing to opt for treatments that make them appear younger. \r\n\r\nNext, due to the adoption of western culture, people are drifting away from their traditions. Additionally, fame and materialistic gains have become the symbol of success for many pupils that they believe will be lost if they do not keep their outlook enhanced resulting in the wastage of financial resources. To exemplify, huge spending is being normalized by actresses to get younger-looking perfect skin and features in order to gain continuous work in films and television thus inculcating an inferiority complex in the middle age women around the globe.\r\n\r\nTo summarize, instead of opting for artificial alternatives, one should resort to natural ways of maintaining their body and mind.

I believe there are positives and negatives to this approach which I will analyze in this essay.\r\n\r\nFirst of all, I agree that increasing the cost of fuel for cars and other vehicles is one of the best ways to solve the environmental problem, because nowadays there are too many cars running on the roads. Almost everyone has a car and do not like to use public transportation because it is difficult to go to work by bus or metro especially from the suburbs. However, if the government raises the price of petrol and make their public transportation systems more enticing, it will make citizens more likely to utilize it.\r\n\r\nThere are multiple methods that the government could implement to persuade people to make more use of public transport and stop using their own cars. For example, if people can get a discount for taking public transportation, they will be willing to do it from time to time. The government could also implement and build infrastructure and systems for people to ride their bicycles. If it is convenient for everyone to rent bikes from one place and return to another, it will become more popular for people to use it and will reduce the amount of time they spend driving their cars which will have a positive effect on the environment.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, it is not only because of people driving cars and the resultant carbon dioxide emissions that the human-race is having a negative impact on the environment, there are a plethora of other factors which are also contributing to this impact. According to many studies, climate change is caused by many different factors which include(s) making (processing meat) products related to meat, manufacturing factories, agricultural fertilization to grow crops...etc. Therefore, all of these factors and different areas of human activity cause environmental problems which results in climate change.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, though there are many issues which contribute to the environmental problem, I believe increasing the price of fuel will have an overall positive effect by encouraging people to utilize different modes of transport and

For example, if gasoline is more expensive, people will tend to use the bus or train rather than their personal cars. Besides, it is able to improve the efficiency of house appliances such as air conditioning, heating, cooking and so on to lead the greener life, meanwhile the government could pass laws to limit the emission from manufacturing operations by using renewable energy from solar, wind and water power.\n\nThe cost of fuel is proportionate to higher production, which depends on machines generated by fossil fuel. For the inhabitants, especially ones living in poor countries may struggle with higher living conditions. I believe that the government play a paramount role in investing more in alternative energy for sustainable growth, and the most effective solution is to educate people for everyday awareness of our energy use and the carbon dioxide emissions.\n\nTaking everything into consideration, increasing the tax on fuel cost is a short-term solution to address the environmental problems.\n\nProvide your assessment in the specified JSON format."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"per_criterion\": [{\"name\": \"Task Response\", \"band\": 7.5, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"Most pressing problems in the world nowadays is environmental damage\", \"Besides, it is able to improve the efficiency of house appliances such as air conditioning, heating, cooking and so on to lead the greener life, meanwhile the government could pass laws to limit the emission from manufacturing operations by using renewable energy from solar, wind and water power\", \"Taking everything into consideration, increasing the tax on fuel cost is a short-term solution to address the environmental problems\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"Most pressing problems in the world nowadays is environmental damage\", \"type\": \"task\", \"fix\": \"Consider improving the task response aspect here.\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Develop your main arguments more fully with specific examples.\", \"Ensure you address all parts of the question directly.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Coherence & Cohesion\", \"band\": 6.5, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"Most pressing problems in the world nowadays is environmental damage\", \"Besides, it is able to improve the efficiency of house appliances such as air conditioning, heating, cooking and so on to lead the greener life, meanwhile the government could pass laws to limit the emission from manufacturing operations by using renewable energy from solar, wind and water power\", \"Taking everything into consideration, increasing the tax on fuel cost is a short-term solution to address the environmental problems\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"Most pressing problems in the world nowadays is environmental damage\", \"type\": \"coherence\", \"fix\": \"Consider improving the coherence & cohesion aspect here.\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Use more varied linking words to connect your ideas.\", \"Improve paragraph structure with clearer topic sentences.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Lexical Resource\", \"band\": 6.5, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"Most pressing problems in the world nowadays is environmental damage\", \"Besides, it is able to improve the efficiency of house appliances such as air conditioning, heating, cooking and so on to lead the greener life, meanwhile the government could pass laws to limit the emission from manufacturing operations by using renewable energy from solar, wind and water power\", \"Taking everything into consideration, increasing the tax on fuel cost is a short-term solution to address the environmental problems\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"Most pressing problems in the world nowadays is environmental damage\", \"type\": \"lexical\", \"fix\": \"Consider improving the lexical resource aspect here.\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Use more sophisticated vocabulary and avoid repetition.\", \"Focus on precise word choice and natural collocations.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Grammatical Range & Accuracy\", \"band\": 7.5, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"Most pressing problems in the world nowadays is environmental damage\", \"Besides, it is able to improve the efficiency of house appliances such as air conditioning, heating, cooking and so on to lead the greener life, meanwhile the government could pass laws to limit the emission from manufacturing operations by using renewable energy from solar, wind and water power\", \"Taking everything into consideration, increasing the tax on fuel cost is a short-term solution to address the environmental problems\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"Most pressing problems in the world nowadays is environmental damage\", \"type\": \"grammar\", \"fix\": \"Consider improving the grammatical range & accuracy aspect here.\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Use more complex sentence structures.\", \"Check for grammatical errors and improve accuracy.\"]}], \"overall\": 7.0, \"votes\": [7.0, 7.0, 7.0], \"dispersion\": 0.0, \"confidence\": \"high\", \"meta\": {\"prompt_hash\": \"training_data\", \"model\": \"training\", \"schema_version\": \"v1\", \"rubric_version\": \"rubric/v1\", \"token_usage\": {\"input_tokens\": 277, \"output_tokens\": 500}}}"}]}
