Other people believe that it has little or no real impact. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.\n\nScore this IELTS Task 2 essay according to the rubric, ensuring alignment with the question:\n\nIn this contemporary epoch, whilst opponents hold the view that advertisments have no influence on a person's life, proponents and I are of the belief that they are of a paramount influence on people's lives, as they have a malignant effect on consumers' bank statements. In this essay, both views will be demonstrated along with my contention.\r\n\r\nOn the one hand, many social media specialists are of the belief that marketing strategies do not have any influence on consumer's decisions. In other words, when there is a campaign for a new product, consumers can ignore it because they may know the reality of advertisments, and how it is used to mislead them. An eminent example is Egypt where you can find a plethora of different posts and advertisments about new products and the nations do not buy them because they know that it is useless to them, and they will be deceived by such campaigns. Hence, what can be said is that people can ignore posts, advertisments and banners because they know the reality of advertisments.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, many economists believe that marketing campaigns have a deleterious effect on one's life, as they affect their welfare. To clarify, if there is a new product launched by a company, people may buy it because it has new technology even if they do not need this new feature. This will lead to a negative effect on their money, as they will spend a plethora of it on something which they do not need. A salient example is Egypt where you can find many citizens wearing Apple watches that cost a lot, however; they do not know how to use them, or they only need to know the time leaving its features without maximizing their benefits from it. Therefore, advertisments lead to spontaneous purchasing leading to a malignant effect on people's money.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, after this essay has manifested the above-mentioned points, it has commonly been assumed that not only do many believe that advertisments play a detrimental role in people's decision-making, but few of them may also believe that they have no effect on anyone.\n\nProvide your assessment in the specified JSON format."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"per_criterion\": [{\"name\": \"Task Response\", \"band\": 7.0, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"proponents and I are of the belief that they are of a paramount influence on people's lives\", \"many economists believe that marketing campaigns have a deleterious effect on one's life\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"adverisments\", \"type\": \"spelling error\", \"fix\": \"advertisements\"}, {\"span\": \"the nations do not buy them\", \"type\": \"clarity issue\", \"fix\": \"the citizens do not buy them\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Ensure consistent spelling of key terms like 'advertisements' throughout the essay.\", \"Clarify ambiguous phrases to enhance understanding, such as specifying 'citizens' instead of 'nations' when discussing consumer behavior.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Coherence & Cohesion\", \"band\": 6.0, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"In this essay, both views will be demonstrated along with my contention.\", \"To clarify, if there is a new product launched by a company, people may buy it because it has new technology even if they do not need this new feature.\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"as they have a malignant effect on consumers' bank statements.\", \"type\": \"repetition\", \"fix\": \"Replace 'malignant effect' with a synonym to avoid redundancy.\"}, {\"span\": \"the nations do not buy them because they know that it is useless to them, and they will be deceived by such campaigns.\", \"type\": \"clarity\", \"fix\": \"Clarify 'the nations' to 'the consumers' for better understanding.\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Use more varied vocabulary to avoid repetition, especially with terms like 'advertisments' and 'malignant effect.'\", \"Ensure each paragraph has a clear topic sentence that summarizes the main idea to enhance coherence.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Lexical Resource\", \"band\": 6.0, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"they are of a paramount influence on people's lives\", \"they affect their welfare\", \"advertisments lead to spontaneous purchasing leading to a malignant effect on people's money\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"advertisments\", \"type\": \"spelling\", \"fix\": \"advertisements\"}, {\"span\": \"a plethora of different posts and advertisments\", \"type\": \"repetition\", \"fix\": \"a plethora of different posts and advertisements\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Use a wider range of vocabulary to avoid repetition, such as using synonyms for 'advertisements'.\", \"Pay attention to spelling errors to enhance overall clarity and professionalism in writing.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Grammatical Range & Accuracy\", \"band\": 7.0, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"In this contemporary epoch, whilst opponents hold the view that advertisments have no influence on a person's life\", \"many economists believe that marketing campaigns have a deleterious effect on one's life\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"advertisments\", \"type\": \"spelling error\", \"fix\": \"advertisements\"}, {\"span\": \"the nations do not buy them\", \"type\": \"subject-verb agreement\", \"fix\": \"the nation does not buy them\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Ensure consistent spelling of key terms, such as 'advertisements', to enhance clarity.\", \"Use singular forms correctly when referring to a collective noun, for example, 'the nation' instead of 'the nations' when discussing a specific country.\"]}], \"overall\": 6.5}"}]}

I, personally, believe that a shift in the educational system is inevitable due to the rampant progress that technology is registering.\r\n\r\nNowadays, it is already noticeable a change in teaching techniques between parents and children generations. For instance, the oldest group had to bring daily physical books to follow lessons, youngsters can easily attend class with their laptop or have an interactive day, like videos and searching online information and so on. Furthermore, the disparity became more evident after the COVID-19 pandemic. When people were forced to isolate and maintain physical distance, government tried to push citizens to carry a normal life, starting by requesting schools to hold their class online. Although they had to face many difficulties in order to make a sudden vast adjustment, the results were comforting and hopeful. \r\n\r\nAnother justification on why I agree that in the future class will not be in person anymore is that every person has access to an internet broadband, thus lectures can be online. Multiple reasons attest that this method is more effective and efficient. Firstly, it cuts the cost of commuting to and from school, helping families with their own financial budget, and diminish the risks of accidents during travel time. Moreover, the advanced way of lecturing will promote a responsible and independent behaviour. Not only will pupils learn the importance of these two characteristics, but they will approach a similar work condition, where they will be promoted if they are able to work or study unsupervised. \r\n\r\nTo conclude, from my point of view, many situations will change in the following 30 years, but these will be extremely evident in the education system, where new technologies will be adopted to implement students' conditions and final learning results.

Others think that they have no effect on artists. In this essay, I will discuss both views and suggest my opinion.\r\n\r\nNowadays, people can get everything they want by surfing the Internet. Even we can watch the latest movie, and download the latest hit music from any site. For example, iPhones have apple music that consumers can buy artists' albums, but sometimes people think why pay for a subscription when can download from illegal sites without any charge? \r\n\r\nHence, illegal internet downloads are harsh for artists' legal authority, they are selling their products on legal platforms but illegal platforms are just streaming their hard work for free.In my opinion, illegal internet downloads do have a negative impact on the music industry, if people want  their favourite artist's music they should pay for it, this way it's fair for both sides.\r\n\r\nOn the other side, some feel that illegal loads have little impact or no impact on artists.I wouldn't agree with this perspective. For example, recently some famous artists' albums got leaked before the release date, and all the fans had listened to the entire album, even memorized lyrics, due to that artist releasing his album before the official date.These kinds of incidents happen to most artists.

From my point of view, I agree with this view and think that student will be more cooperate with each other when they play sport together. In the following paragraphs, the reasons to support my opinion will be outlined in detail.\r\n\r\nTo begin with, I strongly believe that sport can boost unity among the group of children for many reason. For the first reason, each player in team sports has their own specific duty in the game, therefore the result of a game will be depended on the abilities to organize players and teamwork. In the other word, if players in a team do not understand each other's skill or abandon some role in the team, such as goalkeeper in football, they will lose the game easily. As a result, children who play team sports have to be teamwork to defeat their opponent, and losing is an awesome way to teach them to cooperate.\r\n\r\nAnother reason is that there are many rules that can affect the game in the negative way if players do not have sportmanship, which teamwork is a part of it, and childrens will be taught to cooperate with thair team when they break the rule and be punished. In the other word, these rules are made for controlling players to have sportmanship and cooperate with their team, and players that do not have teamwork will be punished. Therefore, children who break the rule, such as getting red card in football and cannot participate the game until the end, will be acknowledged that they have to cooperate with team, and improve themselves in the next game. Therefore, team sport is the most effective way to teach children to cooperate with each other.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, playing team sports can cause players cooperate with their team, and this adventage can be use to teach children to cooperate with their friends in the school.

Discuss both views and give your opinions\n\nScore this IELTS Task 2 essay according to the rubric, ensuring alignment with the question:\n\nIn modern-day society, some countries allow their inhabitants to posses guns at home. As far as this argument goes, this phenomenon has both merits and demerits; however, the disadvantages overwhelm the advantages. \r\n\r\nFirst and foremost, this part of the essay depicts a plus of the issue. It can be clearly seen that being able to ensure families’ safety is a noteworthy advantage. Indeed, by possessing guns at home can residents maintain their security towards potential menace such as terrorists or armed thieves. For instance, a buglar sneaked into my acquaintance's house, threatening his family members using a knife. However, my acquaintance was able to force the stealer to go away by taking out his shotgun. \r\n\r\nFurthermore, when the second stance is taken into account, it can be envisioned that the minuses outnumber the pluses. First of all, the increasing incidence of crime and vice is a concerning issue. As an example, it is estimated that the number of young offenders’ attacks towards schools skyrocketed by 200 cases in the course of 11 years, commencing from 2011.

I feel that schools have to fulfil both things but the primary aim is   towards the welfare of the society and the benefit to the individual automatically   ensues.     Schooling can do a lot for shaping children. Firstly, school is a system with so many possibilities for a child to grow into what he or she actually is. For  example, teachers are able to mould children by identifying their hidden   strengths, and the same strength may later make the child what he actually is in   this world for.     Secondly, since children spend a sizeable amount of their time with teachers   and a community of boys and girls from different faiths, statuses and family   values - there is great possibility for a child to undergo a transformation into a good human being. Teachers are a great force to influence children.     Of course, learning academic subjects is the main aim for what students go to   schools. Definitely, the job market requires professional knowledge the most.   But it is also true that if students become good citizens and workers, they are   themselves equally benefited too.  To put it in a nutshell, I pen down saying that, raising children into real human   beings involves several factors. Among them, the prominent one is good   schooling.

However, there is a tendency to believe that guided learning and other conventional traits of education can be faded away by 2050. I truly believe that the teaching system will be light years ahead of what we have at present moment due to the technological breakthrough and drawbacks of teacher-led lessons. \r\n\r\nFirstly, robots may provide insightful knowledge and assess students’ performance instead of human teachers. Recent technological innovations demonstrate that human labor can be replaced by machines as well as robots are able to perform the same work at the same level. The modern educational system is not the exception for that. Internet is already full of reliable sources, which could be used by students independently. For instance, some schools and esteemed universities such as Cambridge practice autonomous learning via laptops with guidelines. \r\n\r\nSecondly, plenty of situations related to teacher-student relationships shows that there are alarming drawbacks associated with this type of teaching and learning. The human factor leads to some educators having biased attitude towards different students. Thus, unfair evaluation can very likely discourage students from taking part in the subject, thereby they lose natural inquisitiveness. The education authorities are already concerned with this issue, therefore the tradition of teacher-led studying can be replaced by something else in further future. \r\n\r\nTo conclude, I suspect that though studying process is tightly related to guided learning, technological development and detrimental sides of providing information through human will change the perspective of educating systems. \r\n\r\n260 words\n\nProvide your assessment in the specified JSON format."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"per_criterion\": [{\"name\": \"Task Response\", \"band\": 5.5, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"I truly believe that the teaching system will be light years ahead of what we have at present moment due to the technological breakthrough and drawbacks of teacher-led lessons.\", \"The human factor leads to some educators having biased attitude towards different students.\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"the tradition of teacher-led studying can be replaced by something else in further future.\", \"type\": \"clarity\", \"fix\": \"the tradition of teacher-led studying can be replaced by alternative methods in the near future.\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Provide more specific examples of how technology will change education to strengthen the argument.\", \"Clarify the conclusion to better summarize the main points and reinforce the thesis.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Coherence & Cohesion\", \"band\": 4.5, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"the teaching system will be light years ahead of what we have at present moment due to the technological breakthrough and drawbacks of teacher-led lessons.\", \"plenty of situations related to teacher-student relationships shows that there are alarming drawbacks associated with this type of teaching and learning.\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"thereby they lose natural inquisitiveness.\", \"type\": \"lack of clarity in pronoun reference\", \"fix\": \"replace 'they' with 'students' for clarity\"}, {\"span\": \"therefore the tradition of teacher-led studying can be replaced by something else in further future.\", \"type\": \"awkward phrasing\", \"fix\": \"rephrase to 'therefore, the tradition of teacher-led education may be replaced by alternative methods in the near future.'\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Use clearer pronouns to avoid ambiguity, ensuring that it is always clear who or what is being referred to.\", \"Improve sentence structure by avoiding awkward phrasing and ensuring that ideas flow logically from one to the next.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Lexical Resource\", \"band\": 4.5, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"the teaching system will be light years ahead of what we have at present moment\", \"plenty of situations related to teacher-student relationships shows that there are alarming drawbacks\", \"the tradition of teacher-led studying can be replaced by something else in further future\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"the tradition of teacher-led studying can be replaced by something else in further future\", \"type\": \"word choice\", \"fix\": \"the tradition of teacher-led studying can be replaced by something else in the near future\"}, {\"span\": \"the human factor leads to some educators having biased attitude towards different students\", \"type\": \"article usage\", \"fix\": \"the human factor leads to some educators having a biased attitude towards different students\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Use a wider range of vocabulary to express ideas more precisely and avoid repetition.\", \"Pay attention to article usage and ensure that nouns are appropriately modified.\", \"Incorporate more complex sentence structures to enhance the overall quality of writing.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Grammatical Range & Accuracy\", \"band\": 5.5, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"the teaching system will be light years ahead of what we have at present moment due to the technological breakthrough and drawbacks of teacher-led lessons.\", \"plenty of situations related to teacher-student relationships shows that there are alarming drawbacks associated with this type of teaching and learning.\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"plenty of situations related to teacher-student relationships shows\", \"type\": \"subject-verb agreement\", \"fix\": \"plenty of situations related to teacher-student relationships show\"}, {\"span\": \"the tradition of teacher-led studying can be replaced by something else in further future\", \"type\": \"word choice\", \"fix\": \"the tradition of teacher-led studying can be replaced by something else in the near future\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Ensure subject-verb agreement is maintained throughout the essay.\", \"Use more precise language to convey ideas clearly, especially when discussing time frames.\"]}], \"overall\": 5.0}"}]}

Although there will be undoubtedly be some negative consequences of this trend, individuals and government can take steps to mitigate these potential problems.\r\n\r\nThere are two main reasons why the growth of the consumer goods industry is related to the environment. Firstly, manufacturing consumer goods need a lot of materials, but after the production is completed, the waste materials will be discharged into the environment. This means it will destroy the natural environment, all living species occupying the habitat will have reduced breeding capacity; thus populations will decline, and extinction becomes more likely. Secondly, the appearance of factories and companies decreases the natural lands, including forests and villages, which means people will lose an amount of oxygen from trees. Moreover, it can cause a greenhouse effect because the exhaust fumes from factories emit too much, the trees are cut down.\r\n\r\nThere are several actions that governments could take to solve the problems described above. Governments should impose strict laws related to discharge of waste to manufacturers. If the amount of waste and exhaust fumes are higher than the regulatory amount, the factories or companies have to be punished. This leads to governments controlling waste and minimizing pollution. The other solution is that the government can request and encourage factories and citizens to grow trees. As a result, it can be balanced for the number of trees.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, various measures can be taken to tackle the problems that are certain to arise as the manufacture of consumer goods increases.\n\nProvide your assessment in the specified JSON format."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"per_criterion\": [{\"name\": \"Task Response\", \"band\": 6.5, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"manufacturing consumer goods need a lot of materials, but after the production is completed, the waste materials will be discharged into the environment.\", \"Governments should impose strict laws related to discharge of waste to manufacturers.\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"the appearance of factories and companies decreases the natural lands\", \"type\": \"clarity\", \"fix\": \"rephrase to clarify that factories and companies occupy natural lands\"}, {\"span\": \"the trees are cut down\", \"type\": \"grammatical accuracy\", \"fix\": \"change to 'if trees are cut down' to maintain parallel structure\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Provide more specific examples of how government actions can mitigate environmental damage.\", \"Clarify the relationship between consumer goods production and environmental impact in the introduction.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Coherence & Cohesion\", \"band\": 5.5, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"there will be undoubtedly be some negative consequences of this trend\", \"manufacturing consumer goods need a lot of materials\", \"governments should impose strict laws related to discharge of waste to manufacturers\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"manufacturing consumer goods need a lot of materials\", \"type\": \"subject-verb agreement\", \"fix\": \"manufacturing consumer goods needs a lot of materials\"}, {\"span\": \"the trees are cut down\", \"type\": \"lack of clarity\", \"fix\": \"the cutting down of trees\"}, {\"span\": \"it can be balanced for the number of trees\", \"type\": \"vague expression\", \"fix\": \"it can help restore the number of trees\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Ensure subject-verb agreement throughout the essay.\", \"Clarify vague expressions to improve understanding.\", \"Use more cohesive devices to link ideas between sentences and paragraphs.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Lexical Resource\", \"band\": 5.5, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"more and more consumer goods are manufactured\", \"the waste materials will be discharged into the environment\", \"governments should impose strict laws related to discharge of waste to manufacturers\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"manufacturing consumer goods need a lot of materials\", \"type\": \"subject-verb agreement\", \"fix\": \"manufacturing consumer goods needs a lot of materials\"}, {\"span\": \"the trees are cut down\", \"type\": \"tense inconsistency\", \"fix\": \"the trees being cut down\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Use more varied vocabulary to express ideas, avoiding repetition of phrases like 'consumer goods' and 'environment'.\", \"Ensure subject-verb agreement is maintained throughout the essay for grammatical accuracy.\", \"Incorporate more complex sentence structures to enhance the overall lexical sophistication.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Grammatical Range & Accuracy\", \"band\": 6.5, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"Although there will be undoubtedly be some negative consequences of this trend\", \"the waste materials will be discharged into the environment\", \"Governments should impose strict laws related to discharge of waste to manufacturers\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"there will be undoubtedly be some negative consequences\", \"type\": \"redundant auxiliary verb\", \"fix\": \"there will undoubtedly be some negative consequences\"}, {\"span\": \"manufacturing consumer goods need a lot of materials\", \"type\": \"subject-verb agreement\", \"fix\": \"manufacturing consumer goods needs a lot of materials\"}, {\"span\": \"the trees are cut down\", \"type\": \"tense consistency\", \"fix\": \"the trees being cut down\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Vary sentence structures to include more complex sentences and clauses.\", \"Ensure subject-verb agreement is maintained throughout the essay.\", \"Avoid redundancy in phrases to enhance clarity and conciseness.\"]}], \"overall\": 6.0}"}]}

However, other people opine that they are perilous and have many negative influences on the community. The upcoming paragraphs will not only examine the both viewpoints, but also my own opinion.\n\nTo commence with, some people claim that robots are the most significant role in the human forthcoming development. First of all it saves the time of the public, as people are very busy in their daily routine, they work hard for earning a lot of money from their company. But they do not get opportunity spend time with friends as well as family, if they use equipments, which are used in their house. They can pressure their hobbies and utilise time with others. Therefore some layman considers that machineries are better for the human planned growth. Besides this, they can do the job, if they are using gadgets.  It is faster, convenient as well as comfortable. To illustrate, only women work their household chores, if they used kitchen gadgets. Which will be very beneficial for them, and they can go from working outside.\n\nOn the flip side, others opine that robots have negative effects for the human future progressive, because robots are dangers. First and foremost point is that, as we know very well it become people lazy as well as addict some diseases. For example, some people use machines in not the limit. It impacts on the human growth of health.

I personally think it is impossible as climate changes affect not only human beings but also everything on the earth. This essay will highlight why we cannot find a way to live with the climate change.\n\nFirstly, an important thing to note is that we cannot adjust with the changes of the environment as human beings have been using nature in this world. For example, the University of Queensland shows that we live on lands which only occupy 30% of the earth. Furthermore, we eat animals and plants which grow well with the current climate so it might cause starvation around the world. Therefore, it is not easy to find a way to live with the climate changes such as the rise of the sea level and global warming because it will impact on the levels of animals and the livable land. .\nIn addition, it is easier to prevent climate change than find the way to live with the changes. As I mentioned above, Changing of climate would affect to any kind of environment, such as the ecosystem and the environment. Once we accept the change, we need to keep adjusting the changes which would affect everything in our lives, as it is unstoppable. \n\nIn conclusion, I personally think we should keep an eye on climate change and try to prevent it since it is impossible to keep adjusting.

I tend to agree that government plays an active role in ensuring that its citizens lead a healthy behaviour but I believe that it is the responsibility of people to follow the perfect diet's plan.\r\n\r\nOn the one hand, many  of the legislators across the world impose some laws concerning nutritious meal in an effort to have a healthier population to minimize the public health cost. Even this could be  a good idea but it is very difficult to implement. To achieve this, the rulers could impose a heavy levy on the products which are not suitable for people and as a consequence, lead to various health ailments. In Italy, For instance, products such as carbonated sugary drinks and chips are heavily taxed to decrease the sale of these items in the grocery stores. As a result, many of them already are already stopped to consume these products because of the high amount. However, by making such laws, it could create dissatisfaction among local individuals.\r\n\r\nOn the other side, since personal freedom is an extremely crucial human right, so a  significant amount of people think that they should be responsible for foodstuff choices. Even though the government is done for the betterment of citizens but it creates a sense of resentment and as a consequence, it leads to some other public issues such as demonstrations and protest. So, it is the human decision to pursue a  healthy behaviour or not.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, I also reckon that it is a personal choice and duty of individuals to follow a healthy and nutritious diet plan to lead a happy life. Besides this, the rulers can also play an important role by setting some examples of famous personalities so that people could influence them and follow the same path. As a result, these things help the public to make better decisions regarding meal consumption.\r\n\r\nTo sum up, Although, governments are taking some measures to ensure people lead a healthy

This means that they have become aspects of life with great global significance as a result many nations are working together to tackle this areas of human existence. A group of people have suggested that the collaboration between countries are more towards safekeeping the environs other than promoting business whereas another group are of the opinion that the reverse is the case. I belong to the school of thought who believes that the most important reason for interregional relations is to ehance and explore global business.\r\n\r\nFirstly, trade provides funding for the smooth running of the society. Humans are known to be deficient in some of the things they require for their basic needs, hence, the need to exchange what one possesses in return for what he needs. This can been expressed also among countries as each country has its own resources and may depend on other countries to get what they are lacking. For example, the international relationship between the USA and Nigeria has promoted the trade of crude oil and its products among these nations.In addition, mutual interest in trade stands as a protection for the regions involved. Communities are more interested in building business connections with other communities because of the peace that it may provide. This prevents the economic disruption that may face both countries if they are at war with each other.

Increasing in the global population and people becoming more prosperous are two main causes of this issue. This essay will not only discuss about those root causes, but it will also introduce some solutions to tackle the problem. \n\nFirstly, the increase in the world population, especially in the developing countries such as India and China, is a main reason for the growth of the goods consumption. For example, the more citizens using papers, the more tree being cut in order to produe papers. Additionally, the demand of people who are richer than the past is increasing also, for example, the rich citizens can own multiple high-end cell phone or another electric device like iPad or laptops. Consequently, the consumer goods are being produced much more than ever to meet the demand from the countries. \n\nRegarding solutions, there are two ways that the government can take it into consideration to eliminate the issue. Firstly, educating people to have simple living is one of the good ways that the authority should consider, for instance, introducing a simple living style in Japan and its benefit in the online channels. Furthermore, the government should invest more money in the recycling systems, such as paper, water, electric device recycling systems. Those systems definitely help to reduce using the natural resources like wood to produce paper. \n\nIn conclusion, the global population increasing and the demand from the rich people also growing are the main factors for the problem.

Do you agree or disagree?\n\nScore this IELTS Task 2 essay according to the rubric, ensuring alignment with the question:\n\nIn this contemporary epoch, there is a widely held perception in many parts of the world these days that customs and traditions have become irrelevant to this fast-paced life. Although there are certainly valid arguments to the contrary, I personally believe that nations' cultural heritage requires amelioration for the sake of better relations within nations and families. In this essay, 2 of the primary reasons why I totally agree with the need for a change in traditional ways of thinking will be further elaborated.\r\n\r\nTo embark on,  first and also the most crucial reason relates to the fact that inherited traditions have become an obstacle that hinders different people from various ethnic backgrounds from socializing. In other words, if every nation tends to preserve its customs, the world will suffer from global wars ,particularly when obstacles between countries have blurred. This can be witnessed by social media platforms which permitted such fast transactions of information between various nations. Therefore, what can be said is that in order to cope with the requirements of globalization, the traditional ways of behaviours ought to be drastically changed. \r\n\r\nFurthermore, the undue keeping of inherited traditions gives rise to conflicts among families since the current generation has a completely different way of thinking. This means that when breadwinners start to change their obsolete thoughts, they will communicate more efficiently with their minors and such a massive generation gap will be resolved. One particularly salient example of this is parenting courses in which guardians are taught how to get rid of their old thoughts and become equipped and updated with the latest information. Accordingly, in a final analysis, I would contend that since the current generation has special needs, custodians have to understand their needs.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, after this essay has manifested the above-mentioned points, it can be reiterated that not only does the superfluous preservation of traditions worsen the communication among nations but also this occurs within families.

Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.\n\nScore this IELTS Task 2 essay according to the rubric, ensuring alignment with the question:\n\nNowadays, there are many students who are at university or college find difficult to learn than when they studied at school. This essay will explore some reasons behind this phenomenon befor suggesting some solutions to tackle this issue. \r\n\r\nThere are several reasons that make students find harder when studying at university or college. Firstly, the transition to higher level education is difficult for students to follow. The curriculum at university or college requires more concentration and self-study than which they studied at school. The reason is given that when they studied at school, their old teachers might give them different examples and exercises in each lessons. Thanks to that, student when studied at school could understand the knowledge more effectively and easier. In contrast, when they continue to study at university or college, most of students have to look up information about the lecture in the Internet or in specialized books by themselves to do complex reseach projects with minimal guidance from their teachers. Secondly, students are often facing up with many classes with large number of students. These classes can make some students find harder to connect with their professors. As the result, the individualized support may decrease. This is also very different from what they received from their old teachers at school. Due to the smaller class size, old teachers could focus on all students, so they could know each student's weaknesses and strengths to help them improve their strengths and fix their weaknesses. \r\n\r\nTo address these challenges, students should be more proactive in their leaning processes. For example, when the students have questions about the lecture, they should meet their professors to ask them their questions after the class ended. Most of professors may spend little of their time to answer student's questions. By this way, many students can understand deeper about the lecture. Moreover, universities and colleges should divide classes into different smaller classes. Thanks to this solution, professors can focus more on their students and enhance the quality of the lecture. \r\n\r\nIn conclusion, the transition from school to university or college can bring several challenges for many students due to the requirement of concentration and self-study and the lack of individualized support. However, by the proactive of students and smaller classes can solve these issues.\n\nProvide your assessment in the specified JSON format."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"per_criterion\": [{\"name\": \"Task Response\", \"band\": 4.5, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"This essay will explore some reasons behind this phenomenon befor suggesting some solutions to tackle this issue.\", \"the transition from school to university or college can bring several challenges for many students due to the requirement of concentration and self-study and the lack of individualized support.\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"students who are at university or college find difficult to learn\", \"type\": \"clarity\", \"fix\": \"students who are at university or college find it difficult to learn\"}, {\"span\": \"the individualized support may decrease\", \"type\": \"specificity\", \"fix\": \"the individualized support may be less available\"}, {\"span\": \"by the proactive of students and smaller classes can solve these issues.\", \"type\": \"grammar\", \"fix\": \"the proactivity of students and smaller classes can help solve these issues.\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Clarify the main argument by explicitly stating the challenges faced by students in university compared to school.\", \"Ensure that each paragraph clearly relates back to the main question and provides specific examples or solutions.\", \"Improve grammatical accuracy to enhance clarity and coherence throughout the essay.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Coherence & Cohesion\", \"band\": 3.5, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"This essay will explore some reasons behind this phenomenon befor suggesting some solutions to tackle this issue.\", \"To address these challenges, students should be more proactive in their leaning processes.\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"students who are at university or college find difficult to learn than when they studied at school\", \"type\": \"grammatical error\", \"fix\": \"students who are at university or college find it more difficult to learn than when they studied at school\"}, {\"span\": \"the individualized support may decrease\", \"type\": \"cohesion error\", \"fix\": \"the individualized support may decrease due to larger class sizes\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Ensure that each paragraph has a clear topic sentence that relates back to the thesis statement.\", \"Use more linking words and phrases to connect ideas and improve the flow of the essay.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Lexical Resource\", \"band\": 3.5, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"the transition to higher level education is difficult for students to follow\", \"students should be more proactive in their leaning processes\", \"the individualized support may decrease\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"find difficult to learn than when they studied at school\", \"type\": \"word choice\", \"fix\": \"find it more difficult to learn than when they studied at school\"}, {\"span\": \"students are often facing up with many classes\", \"type\": \"incorrect phrase\", \"fix\": \"students often face many classes\"}, {\"span\": \"by this way\", \"type\": \"incorrect phrase\", \"fix\": \"in this way\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Use more varied vocabulary to express ideas clearly and accurately.\", \"Pay attention to common collocations and phrases to improve fluency.\", \"Practice using complex sentence structures to enhance lexical variety.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Grammatical Range & Accuracy\", \"band\": 4.5, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"the transition to higher level education is difficult for students to follow.\", \"students should be more proactive in their leaning processes.\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"students who are at university or college find difficult\", \"type\": \"subject-verb agreement\", \"fix\": \"students who are at university or college find it difficult\"}, {\"span\": \"the individualized support may decrease\", \"type\": \"article usage\", \"fix\": \"the individualized support may decrease\"}, {\"span\": \"by the proactive of students\", \"type\": \"incorrect phrase\", \"fix\": \"by the proactivity of students\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Ensure subject-verb agreement is maintained throughout the essay.\", \"Use articles correctly to improve clarity and grammatical accuracy.\", \"Replace incorrect phrases with more appropriate terms to enhance the overall quality of writing.\"]}], \"overall\": 4.0}"}]}

However , others think that it has more advantages for the  person. I partially agree with the statement, because I believe two of them are complimentary. \r\n\r\nFirstly, School is a place where children cultivate good habits. Such as manner,and sense of time. Furthermore, kids also learn cooperation and communication in school. The abilities above are the basis of being a good resident and efficient employee, however, they can also advantage individuals in their career lives. For instance, a worker who has a better attitude and always finishes the task on time is more likely to be promoted than others who don’t. Also, teamwork allows individuals to bring their diverse perspectives to problem-solving, which in turn increases their success at arriving at solutions more efficiently and effectively. As a result, we can see that while being a good citizen and worker, the resident can also get benefits.  \r\n\r\nMoreover, a study from the National Taiwan University shows that the education level is disproportionate to the crime rate.Furthermore, as  time changes, finding an individual's interest is becoming more and more important in education.The youth no longer be taught that getting good scores is the only way the be successful in their future life. The educators started to help children search for their passion, instead of telling them what to do is the best. For instance, Taiwan’s high school students not only take normal classes like math, Chinese, and science, but the clubs after school are taken seriously nowadays. \r\n\r\nIn conclusion, formal school help students lay a foundation for becoming a good person in the world, meanwhile, it plays an important role in guiding children to find their own passion.\n\nProvide your assessment in the specified JSON format."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"per_criterion\": [{\"name\": \"Coherence & Cohesion\", \"band\": 6.5, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"the abilities above are the basis of being a good resident and efficient employee\", \"the youth no longer be taught that getting good scores is the only way the be successful in their future life\", \"formal school help students lay a foundation for becoming a good person in the world\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"Such as manner,and sense of time.\", \"type\": \"punctuation error\", \"fix\": \"Change 'Such as manner,and sense of time.' to 'Such as manners and a sense of time.'\"}, {\"span\": \"the youth no longer be taught\", \"type\": \"grammatical error\", \"fix\": \"Change 'the youth no longer be taught' to 'the youth are no longer taught'\"}, {\"span\": \"formal school help students\", \"type\": \"subject-verb agreement error\", \"fix\": \"Change 'formal school help students' to 'formal schools help students'\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Ensure proper punctuation and grammar to enhance clarity, especially in lists and complex sentences.\", \"Use consistent subject-verb agreement to maintain coherence throughout the essay.\", \"Improve transitions between ideas to strengthen the flow of the argument and enhance overall cohesion.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Task Response\", \"band\": 7.0, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"I partially agree with the statement, because I believe two of them are complimentary.\", \"The abilities above are the basis of being a good resident and efficient employee, however, they can also advantage individuals in their career lives.\", \"formal school help students lay a foundation for becoming a good person in the world, meanwhile, it plays an important role in guiding children to find their own passion.\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"the most important thing kids should learn from education institutes is how to become fine residents and workers\", \"type\": \"clarity\", \"fix\": \"rephrase to clarify whether the focus is on citizenship, employability, or both.\"}, {\"span\": \"the youth no longer be taught that getting good scores is the only way the be successful\", \"type\": \"grammar\", \"fix\": \"correct to 'the youth are no longer taught that getting good scores is the only way to be successful.'\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Clarify the main argument in the introduction to specify whether the focus is on citizenship, employability, or both.\", \"Ensure grammatical accuracy throughout the essay to enhance clarity and professionalism.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Lexical Resource\", \"band\": 6.0, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"the most important thing kids should learn from education institutes is how to become fine residents and workers\", \"the abilities above are the basis of being a good resident and efficient employee\", \"the youth no longer be taught that getting good scores is the only way the be successful in their future life\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"fine residents and workers\", \"type\": \"word choice\", \"fix\": \"good citizens and employees\"}, {\"span\": \"the youth no longer be taught\", \"type\": \"grammar\", \"fix\": \"the youth are no longer taught\"}, {\"span\": \"the be successful\", \"type\": \"grammar\", \"fix\": \"to be successful\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Use more precise vocabulary to enhance clarity and avoid ambiguity.\", \"Pay attention to subject-verb agreement and verb forms to improve grammatical accuracy.\", \"Incorporate a wider range of synonyms to demonstrate a broader lexical resource.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Grammatical Range & Accuracy\", \"band\": 6.0, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"School is a place where children cultivate good habits.\", \"The abilities above are the basis of being a good resident and efficient employee.\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"Such as manner,and sense of time.\", \"type\": \"punctuation error\", \"fix\": \"Such as manner and sense of time.\"}, {\"span\": \"the youth no longer be taught that getting good scores is the only way the be successful\", \"type\": \"verb form error\", \"fix\": \"the youth are no longer taught that getting good scores is the only way to be successful\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Ensure proper punctuation, especially with conjunctions and lists.\", \"Use correct verb forms to maintain grammatical accuracy.\"]}], \"overall\": 6.5}"}]}

In other words, the fact that games can help their capacity, however, if they pay attention to them too much, it can cause a disadvantage for them such as a decrease in their score and lack of knowledge. As a result, it can lead to a drawback in education\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, playing sports that are a team can improve a number of their ability such as cooperation.

In my opinion, I totally believe that having university education is very crucial, however, having a job is also a good choice.\n\nOn the one hand, going to university is the best approach. First reason is that there will be more opportunities for who have a good qualifications. Take an example, having a good diploma or higher degrees, you will be hunted by headhunters from popular companies which then you would stand a greater chance of landing a well-paid job. The second reason, it is worthwhile to get knowledge from university or college which is the tool supporting almost of your works. Furthermore, many people say that “The more knowledge you get, the more opportunities you could gain.”. Indeed, graduating from a university where you will have many advices from experts so you would find it is more easily get a job from popular  companies.\n\nOn the other hand, getting a straight job after school also have some benefits. Many people believe that having a job suddenly after school is better because they can earn money as soon as possible. Nowadays, many have ideal that going further after school is unnecessary and it is also more expensive so they prefer to earning money suddenly after school.

While it is a commonly held belief that broadcasting such crimes might cause an adverse effects for society, so it must be removed. From my perspective, I strongly disagree with this statement. This essay will shed a light upon some of the reasons that made me disagree.\r\n\r\nOn one hand, broadcasting crimes description should not be banned from newspaper as it can educate the public about the crimes that happened in their surrounding environment, so they will be aware. For example, if parents heared from the news that there is a certain crime happened such as child raping, they will directly take care about their kids and they will alert them from such danger. Therefore, people must be informed by the dangerous incident around them, so they will take actions. Thus, it becomes apparent that publication crimes in the newspaper have adavantages and should not be banned.\r\n\r\nAnother point to consider is that publicating crimes details might advise people about different methods that criminal use in their crimes. For example, recently most cyberattacks criminals used to send a link to the individuals and fool them and once they open the link, they steel all their money in the bank account. Such methods, the public will not know about it, unless the newspapers had published this kind of crimes. Indeed, this makes it clear that crimes might be usefull to be puplished. \r\n\r\nIn conclusion, the community requires more awareness and education.

Therefore, flora and fauna are indiscriminately destroyed and lost completely instead of being replaced, which pushes many kinds of species on the verge of extinction.

Hence, a wide range of animals becoming die out since human activities is the reason people think that it is too late to revamp the matter.\r\n\r\nWhile the serious consequences on plants and animals which caused by human activities are widely acknowledged, there are still some efficient remedies to address this problem.

Firstly, with the advancement of technology, people access significant data online what they want. That is, there is a wide range of websites which are free and convenient for reaching accurate information about the building or house. Secondly, governments and land registry offices inform people about their house properties. There are many organisations which governments are held to inform people.

However, others think government should spend more money on health and education.

Contrary to, there is a broad idea that the budget of the government should be used for improving education and health. In my view, although arts have an irreplaceability for society,  there are many significant topics, such as education and health, which are waiting to be solved as a first priority. The aim of this essay is to discuss the topic with both the merits and the demerits.\r\n\r\nTo begin with, it is important to bear in mind that health and education are the fundamental rights of every humankind regardless of nationality, religion and sex. Therefore, they should be supplied immediately by the government. When the people have a right to reach a qualified education and organized health care, they would be more productive and satisfied, which is why arts also would flourish more with regards to humans which are supplied the fundamental rights. For example, Maslow Pyramid has said that individuals' needs have an important order and the first step should be handled first. With regard to this, doubtlessly education and health come before the arts as basic needs of people.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, people have been learning the nature of humans and also they are exploring a better way to express themself with the bright power of arts. They would be able to be more aware of the world and as a consequence of it, their benefit to the public should be maximized by learning arts. Furthermore, By investing in arts, the government is able to improve the life quality of the public and they would be more sensitive to the general society's drawbacks such as environmental problems and violence against women. Thus, arts have the potential to make the world a better place than now and there is no doubt that the government should spend money on arts in order to improve society and people quality.\r\n\r\nTo summarize, however teaching arts have the potential to make people more sensitive to each other and their environment, there are many significant problems that should be solved as the high priority such as education and health.\n\nProvide your assessment in the specified JSON format."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"per_criterion\": [{\"name\": \"Task Response\", \"band\": 8.0, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"the budget of the government should be used for improving education and health\", \"education and health come before the arts as basic needs of people\", \"there are many significant problems that should be solved as the high priority such as education and health\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"the government shows a tendency to spend more money on arts than another important issue\", \"type\": \"clarity\", \"fix\": \"the government shows a tendency to spend more money on the arts than on another important issue\"}, {\"span\": \"the bright power of arts\", \"type\": \"word choice\", \"fix\": \"the transformative power of the arts\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Clarify the comparison between arts and other important issues by providing specific examples or statistics.\", \"Strengthen the conclusion by summarizing the main arguments more clearly and emphasizing the priority of education and health.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Coherence & Cohesion\", \"band\": 7.0, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"the budget of the government should be used for improving education and health\", \"health and education are the fundamental rights of every humankind regardless of nationality, religion and sex\", \"arts have the potential to make the world a better place than now\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"Contrary to, there is a broad idea\", \"type\": \"punctuation error\", \"fix\": \"Remove the comma after 'Contrary to' and rephrase for clarity, e.g., 'Contrarily, there is a broad idea that...'\"}, {\"span\": \"the first step should be handled first\", \"type\": \"redundancy\", \"fix\": \"Rephrase to avoid redundancy, e.g., 'the first step should be addressed first'\"}, {\"span\": \"however teaching arts have the potential\", \"type\": \"grammatical error\", \"fix\": \"Add a comma after 'however' and change 'teaching arts' to 'teaching the arts' for clarity\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Use clearer transitions between ideas to enhance flow, such as 'In addition' or 'Moreover' to connect paragraphs.\", \"Ensure that each paragraph has a clear topic sentence to guide the reader on the main idea being discussed.\", \"Avoid redundancy by rephrasing sentences to eliminate repetitive phrases and enhance clarity.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Lexical Resource\", \"band\": 7.0, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"the budget of the government should be used for improving education and health\", \"arts have an irreplaceability for society\", \"the government should spend money on arts in order to improve society and people quality\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"the nature of humans\", \"type\": \"word choice\", \"fix\": \"the nature of humanity\"}, {\"span\": \"they should be supplied immediately by the government\", \"type\": \"word choice\", \"fix\": \"they should be provided immediately by the government\"}, {\"span\": \"the first step should be handled first\", \"type\": \"redundancy\", \"fix\": \"the first step should be prioritized\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Use more precise vocabulary to enhance clarity and avoid redundancy.\", \"Consider varying sentence structures to improve the overall flow of the essay.\", \"Incorporate more academic phrases to strengthen the argument and demonstrate a higher level of lexical resource.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Grammatical Range & Accuracy\", \"band\": 8.0, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"the budget of the government should be used for improving education and health\", \"health and education are the fundamental rights of every humankind regardless of nationality, religion and sex\", \"arts have the potential to make the world a better place than now\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"Contrary to, there is a broad idea\", \"type\": \"punctuation error\", \"fix\": \"Remove the comma after 'Contrary to'\"}, {\"span\": \"the bright power of arts\", \"type\": \"word choice error\", \"fix\": \"Replace 'the bright power of arts' with 'the transformative power of art'\"}, {\"span\": \"however teaching arts have the potential\", \"type\": \"subject-verb agreement error\", \"fix\": \"Change 'have' to 'has' to match the singular subject 'teaching arts'\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Vary sentence structures to enhance the complexity of ideas presented.\", \"Use more precise vocabulary to convey ideas more effectively.\", \"Ensure subject-verb agreement is maintained throughout the essay.\"]}], \"overall\": 7.5}"}]}

Some believe that the government should discourage the use of car other vehicles by putting a heavy tax on traditional fuel. Indeed, in my opinion, this is the most effective way to tackle some of the environmental problem we had.\r\n\r\nFirst and foremost, it is apparent that pollutant emitted by vehicals constitude a major part of air pollution in our country. In particular, old model private cars release three times more sulphate than the contempory one. Since the collapse of the oil price, private car sales have been triple. There is no doubt that the popularity of car uses is linked to fuel pricing, and the governemnt could reverse this trend by inflating the fuel price. It is highly probable that this policy would decrease the number of cars on roads, thus improve the air quality and reduce carbon emittion.\r\n\r\nMoreover, increasing the cost of transportation with fossil fuel would create an incentive for cooperation to switch to other more environmental friendly alternatives, such as electric trucks and rails. These means of transportation consume electricity instead of burning fuels which produce pollutant during the process. Although most of the electricity productions nowadays still depend on buring fossil fuel, they produce a lot less green house gasses compared to vehicals.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, we should expect that the increase of fuel price would lead to cities with less fuel buring vehical and a shift towards eletric vehical.

This essay will argue that the advantages of this outweigh the drawback. I will first demonstrate that the facilitated relationship and immediate announcement update are the benefits, followed by an analysis of how the primary disadvantage, namely time-consuming, is not valid. \r\n\r\nFirstly, public applications are made in order to improve communications among people. Hence, connections are made effortlessly regardless of the location and therefore the well-being in the society enhances. If an individual wants to talk to a friend, who lives in a different country he/she just need to press a click. It has been proved that parents whose children live abroad are delighted to monitor their children's pictures on  Instagram. In addition, because of technological advancements in apps, various information is spread in a second and therefore anyone can access  a variety of broadcasts. Furthermore, reporters could upload their data to these platforms where ever they are.

Many opine that something should be done to combat it whilst others believe we should manage to live with it. I side with the former notion and will give some argument points to illustrate it. \n\nOn the one hand, it is often argued that there is no point in stopping  natural phenomena because they are out of our control. It is a matter of fact that numerous disasters such as T-sunami, earthquakes and devastating storms albeit warned about in advance are unstoppable.  For example, there is nothing that can be done to fight storms in the middle part of Vietnam despite their frequent occurrence. All  we can do is predict them and try to limit the number of casualties to a minimum rate. Hence, it is easy to see why this argument is strongly supported.\n\nOn the other hand, myriad folks concede numerous human beings' activities have contributed enormously to the changes in the climate; therefore, we must be the ones taking action to prevent it from being worse. Regarding individuals, each person can cease using private cars and travel by public transportation to reduce the emissions, which are the main cause of greenhouse gases, leading to global warming.

Although it is irrefutable that economic spring will do a disservice to the surroundings, I oppose this viewpoint since social concerns can be efficiently combatted.\r\n\r\nThere are several compelling rationales behind the environmentalists' fixation on halting the speed of economic expansion and urban sprawl. Certainly, earning a  lucrative revenue is an unattainable target without environmental sacrifices when multifunctional amenities and machinery are to be installed. By the negligence of other instrumental components, if governments only divert their budget to spur economic growth, nature's well-being will be left with a legacy of deterioration. For instance, instead of abating air pollution, Indian administrators have been inclined to prioritize the logistics leap, which undoubtedly comes at the expense of highly contaminated water sources for irrigation. Inevitably, the recurrence of dormant foodborne illnesses will not be ineradicable, overshadowing the redeeming features of a financial surge. \r\n\r\nOtherwise, there are underlying merits of highlighting the pivotal influence of monetary emphasis to address domestic issues. A multipronged approach, fostered by a stable economic status, is a must to dilute public implicit erosion from social upheaval. Consequently, a financial stronghold may fortify a country against potential turbulence, including either external invasion or internal decay. For example, in developed countries, such as the US and Canada, by triggering fast-paced commercial trade, successfully fulfilled the crevices of famine and averted escalating juvenile delinquency as a byproduct. Therefore, to hold a country from inner collapses and crises, the reinforcement in the commercial state is of paramount importance.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, reflecting the adverse impacts of industrialization on the environment by its insidious implications on the populace's health, governments should take steps to keep the issue at bay.

While I understand people’s concern about environmental damage, I still believe to get rid of poverty and hunger economic growth is needed.\r\n\r\nThere are multiple reasons why people support the ban on economical growth. Firstly, owing to industrial growth, air and water pollution levels are shooting. For instance, recent surveys depict that industrial waste is one of the main reasons for polluting clean water resources. Moreover, carbon emission has been at its peak in the last decade due to the rise in the number of industries, which is essential for the economy. Secondly, deforestation, which is done to provide space to industries, is also a huge problem. Cutting down forests results in hampering the water cycle. Floods are also a result of these deforestation activities. For example, North-east India is facing devastating flood situations as the result of deforestation in the Himalayas. These points make the public believe that economical growth has a bad impact on the environment.\r\n\r\nDespite these causes, I still believe to end starvation and hardship strong economy is vital. To start with, economical growth leads to hundreds of job openings, which is quite essential to fight against poverty. If people are earning well, it will be easy for them to provide with the basic needs of their family.

This trend has divided public's opinion into advocates and detractors. Having children later on is a consequence of a few factors.\nFirstly, these days an indispensable role in today's society is in education, which is time consuming and very often young students are unable to become parents due to being focused on the acquisition of new knowledge and gaining professional qualifications.\n\nSecondly, after finishing university, the young generation would rather concentrate\non their future career than on having progeny.\nFurthermore, when they finally establish a strong social and financial position, they are becoming focused on creating a homely environment and introduce their babies to the world. However, sometimes it takes longer than expected due to new generation's diseases such us problem with fertility, that is often the consequence of a stressful and unhealthy lifestyle caused by the rat race.\n\n  Personally, I think that the advantages outweigh the disadvantages, because much more mature parents are taking greater care of their offspring, due to being more patient than younger people.\nMoreover, educated parents are better role models and are able to pass their acquired knowledge to their children.

Firstly, the health benefits of regular cycling can  increase cardiovascular fitness like causes to providing humans muscle strength and flexibility. As a result, people achieve to get improve their posture and coordination - which leads to decreasing stress levels.  Given  that, when people ride a bicycle on the  streets, they will not suffer from congested traffic. Additionally, exercising a car in North Korea has been banned for several years. For instance, the large number of people in North Korea utilize a bike and this factor is one main cause to stopping eco-pollutions. Besides, this situation shows decreasing body fat levels among  humans. \r\n\r\n     On the other hand, applying a car has become popular over humans. For example, more people becoming lazy riding a bike and giving attention only to cars. As a matter of fact, they have to spend long hours in traffic jams. Moreover, cars are increasing the level of air and noise pollution in cities and this causing many inhabitants to suffer from diseases such as respiratory, heart disease or cancers. \r\n\r\n    All in all, operating a bicycle is more important and helpful to population health and I think the government should give more attention to increasing bikes instead of cars.\n\nProvide your assessment in the specified JSON format."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"per_criterion\": [{\"name\": \"Task Response\", \"band\": 8.0, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"the health benefits of regular cycling can increase cardiovascular fitness\", \"operating a bicycle is more important and helpful to population health\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"Bicycle is extremely important to transport vehicle\", \"type\": \"clarity\", \"fix\": \"A bicycle is an extremely important mode of transport\"}, {\"span\": \"applying a car has become popular over humans\", \"type\": \"clarity\", \"fix\": \"using cars has become more popular among people\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Clarify the introduction by explicitly stating the thesis and the main points to be discussed.\", \"Ensure that comparisons between bicycles and cars are consistently clear and relevant throughout the essay.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Coherence & Cohesion\", \"band\": 7.0, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"This essay shall discuss the reasons for this.\", \"Given that, when people ride a bicycle on the streets, they will not suffer from congested traffic.\", \"All in all, operating a bicycle is more important and helpful to population health.\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"Bicycle is extremely important to transport vehicle in order to come into widespread using it\", \"type\": \"grammatical error\", \"fix\": \"Revise to 'Bicycles are extremely important as a mode of transport and should be used more widely.'\"}, {\"span\": \"applying a car has become popular over humans\", \"type\": \"clarity issue\", \"fix\": \"Revise to 'the use of cars has become more popular among people.'\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Ensure subject-verb agreement and proper noun usage throughout the essay.\", \"Use clearer transitions between ideas to improve the flow of the argument.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Lexical Resource\", \"band\": 7.0, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"the health benefits of regular cycling can increase cardiovascular fitness\", \"the large number of people in North Korea utilize a bike\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"Bicycle is extremely important to transport vehicle\", \"type\": \"word choice\", \"fix\": \"Bicycles are extremely important as a mode of transport\"}, {\"span\": \"applying a car has become popular over humans\", \"type\": \"word choice\", \"fix\": \"using cars has become more popular among people\"}, {\"span\": \"this causing many inhabitants to suffer from diseases\", \"type\": \"grammar\", \"fix\": \"this causes many inhabitants to suffer from diseases\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Use more varied vocabulary to express ideas, such as synonyms for 'important' and 'popular'.\", \"Ensure grammatical accuracy, particularly with subject-verb agreement and verb forms.\", \"Consider restructuring sentences for clarity and fluency, especially when presenting complex ideas.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Grammatical Range & Accuracy\", \"band\": 8.0, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"the health benefits of regular cycling can increase cardiovascular fitness\", \"this situation shows decreasing body fat levels among humans\", \"operating a bicycle is more important and helpful to population health\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"Bicycle is extremely important to transport vehicle\", \"type\": \"article usage\", \"fix\": \"Bicycles are extremely important transport vehicles\"}, {\"span\": \"achieve to get improve their posture\", \"type\": \"verb form\", \"fix\": \"achieve improvement in their posture\"}, {\"span\": \"applying a car has become popular over humans\", \"type\": \"preposition usage\", \"fix\": \"using a car has become more popular among humans\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Use plural forms and articles correctly to enhance clarity and grammatical accuracy.\", \"Ensure verb forms are used correctly to maintain grammatical consistency.\", \"Consider using more varied sentence structures to demonstrate a wider range of grammatical constructions.\"]}], \"overall\": 7.5}"}]}

To what extent do you agree or disagree?\n\nScore this IELTS Task 2 essay according to the rubric, ensuring alignment with the question:\n\nOver the last couple of centuries, many advancements in the technological and industrial sectors have exerted a negative impact on the climate of the earth. While a huge number of environmentalists have been calling for  combat against these activities causing climate change, there is a group that proposes that our focus should be more on how to cope with this rather than stopping it. I believe that this group is correct in some aspects and in the following sections I will provide the logic behind my standpoint.\n\n As we are seeing  events like ice melting, the rise of sea levels, greenhouse effects etc. influencing our nature more and more, nature has become the most important talk of  civilization. Scientifically though, this transformation is not something new. Since the inception of our solar system, the surface and surroundings of the planets have been going through modifications for millions of years. Our earth itself has gone through many major reconstructive eras which helped to create a situation where life could be bred. Furthermore, each step of the evolution of living beings  can be broadly attributed to some global massive adjustment in ecology. So we can not completely prevent the mutation of weather, as transformation is the only constant here.\n\nMoreover, if we examine the species that have survived for millions of years, we will find that they have one common capability. And that is  adaptability. As a race, if we want to survive in harsh conditions in a changed scenario, we need to improve our adaptation mechanisms. In the current era, we have the necessary tools and technology to drive  innovation in this sector. For example, we can use genetic engineering to breed crops that can withstand natural disasters, we can improve our immune system,  create micro-organisms that can reconstruct the ozone layer etc.\n\nOn the other hand, there are some natural resources which are limited and natural calamities against which we can't do much. So while putting our effort into enhancing the flexibility towards altered reality, we also need to control the activities which will result in non-reversible damages. For instance, if the Ozone layer is depleted fully, most of the living things on earth will face jeopardy before even we can discover some alternative to deal with such calamity. So balancing the acts is also an important priority.\n\nTo sum up, mother nature will evolve at her own pace and we need to be able to survive difficult phases as her most fit children. Our activities which will act as catalysts for the rate of natural diversification in a negative way should also be controlled but mere control will not guarantee that we will be safe. As history has shown, change is the only inevitable thing, we need better preparation to deal with that rather than fighting that.\n\nProvide your assessment in the specified JSON format."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"per_criterion\": [{\"name\": \"Task Response\", \"band\": 8.0, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"I believe that this group is correct in some aspects and in the following sections I will provide the logic behind my standpoint.\", \"So we can not completely prevent the mutation of weather, as transformation is the only constant here.\", \"To sum up, mother nature will evolve at her own pace and we need to be able to survive difficult phases as her most fit children.\"], \"errors\": [], \"suggestions\": [\"Provide more specific examples or evidence to support claims about adaptability and technological advancements.\", \"Clarify the distinction between coping with climate change and preventing it to strengthen the argument.\", \"Consider addressing potential counterarguments to enhance the depth of the discussion.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Coherence & Cohesion\", \"band\": 7.0, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"I believe that this group is correct in some aspects and in the following sections I will provide the logic behind my standpoint.\", \"To sum up, mother nature will evolve at her own pace and we need to be able to survive difficult phases as her most fit children.\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"the rise of sea levels, greenhouse effects etc.\", \"type\": \"punctuation\", \"fix\": \"Replace 'etc.' with 'etc.' or 'and so on' for better clarity.\"}, {\"span\": \"we also need to control the activities which will result in non-reversible damages.\", \"type\": \"clarity\", \"fix\": \"Rephrase to 'we also need to control activities that could cause irreversible damage.'\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Use clearer transitions between paragraphs to enhance the flow of ideas.\", \"Ensure that all examples are directly related to the main argument to maintain coherence.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Lexical Resource\", \"band\": 7.0, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"many advancements in the technological and industrial sectors have exerted a negative impact on the climate of the earth\", \"the rise of sea levels, greenhouse effects etc. influencing our nature more and more\", \"adaptability.

In the opinion of experts from both developed and developing countries, instead of finding a solution to rectify the drastic climate change, we should deem new methods of living with this substantial condition. According to my verdict, the idea of not untangling the extreme climatic change is completely preposterous, but for short term trying to accommodate is not entirely wrong.\nFirstly, unraveling the climate condition caused abundant money and handful of resources, which could be unendurable for developing countries. Moreover, rectifying the environmental issues that caused climate change could be very time-consuming and hectic. Although human survival is directly dependent on climate condition, various life threatening issues are also existed which demand hotfoot solution. For example, the contagious and life threatening disease corona virus needs more attention to make the vaccine and be curable. Because of this disease the death rate is 56%, and it is very alarmingly  high than death rate due to climate changes.\nVerily, there are other serious issues that need urgent solution, but the idea of not taking measures to control climate hazards is completely outrageous. Extreme climate change not only dangerous for human survival, but also for animals and other natural habitat. For instance, the Forest fires in Australia and many other regions which disturb the natural ecosystem of many animals, are the result of extreme climate changes. Legislation and serious measures should be done by government to prevent and rectify drastic climate changes. Furthermore, climate problem leads to many severe problems like water depletion, shortage of natural resources, and environmental pollution.\nTo conclude, the idea of not preventing extreme climate problems is wholly ridiculous.\n\nProvide your assessment in the specified JSON format."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"per_criterion\": [{\"name\": \"Task Response\", \"band\": 7.5, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"the environment is on the verge of being destroyed\", \"the idea of not untangling the extreme climatic change is completely preposterous\", \"Extreme climate change not only dangerous for human survival, but also for animals and other natural habitat.\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"the contagious and life threatening disease corona virus needs more attention to make the vaccine and be curable\", \"type\": \"relevance\", \"fix\": \"Clarify the connection between COVID-19 and climate change, as it distracts from the main topic.\"}, {\"span\": \"the death rate is 56%, and it is very alarmingly high than death rate due to climate changes\", \"type\": \"clarity\", \"fix\": \"Provide accurate statistics and context for comparison to enhance clarity and relevance.\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Strengthen the argument by providing more specific examples of how climate change impacts human survival and the environment.\", \"Ensure that all points made are directly related to the main argument about climate change to maintain focus.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Coherence & Cohesion\", \"band\": 6.5, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"the idea of not untangling the extreme climatic change is completely preposterous\", \"Extreme climate change not only dangerous for human survival, but also for animals and other natural habitat.\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"the idea of not taking measures to control climate hazards is completely outrageous\", \"type\": \"inconsistency in argumentation\", \"fix\": \"Clarify how this statement relates to the previous discussion on accommodating climate change.\"}, {\"span\": \"the contagious and life threatening disease corona virus needs more attention to make the vaccine and be curable\", \"type\": \"lack of clarity\", \"fix\": \"Rephrase to clarify the connection between the pandemic and climate change.\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Use clearer transitions between ideas to enhance the flow of the argument.\", \"Ensure that all points made are directly relevant to the main argument to avoid confusion.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Lexical Resource\", \"band\": 6.5, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"the environment is on the verge of being destroyed\", \"the idea of not untangling the extreme climatic change is completely preposterous\", \"the contagious and life threatening disease corona virus needs more attention\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"unraveling the climate condition caused abundant money\", \"type\": \"word choice\", \"fix\": \"unraveling the climate condition requires abundant money\"}, {\"span\": \"hotfoot solution\", \"type\": \"collocation\", \"fix\": \"immediate solution\"}, {\"span\": \"not only dangerous for human survival\", \"type\": \"grammar\", \"fix\": \"not only dangerous to human survival\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Use more precise vocabulary to convey ideas clearly, such as replacing 'unraveling' with 'addressing' or 'tackling'.\", \"Avoid using informal expressions like 'hotfoot solution'; instead, opt for formal alternatives like 'immediate solution'.\", \"Ensure correct preposition usage, such as 'dangerous to' instead of 'dangerous for' when discussing risks.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Grammatical Range & Accuracy\", \"band\": 7.5, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"the environment is on the verge of being destroyed\", \"the idea of not untangling the extreme climatic change is completely preposterous\", \"Extreme climate change not only dangerous for human survival, but also for animals and other natural habitat.\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"various life threatening issues are also existed\", \"type\": \"tense agreement\", \"fix\": \"various life threatening issues also exist\"}, {\"span\": \"which disturb the natural ecosystem of many animals, are the result of extreme climate changes\", \"type\": \"comma splice\", \"fix\": \"which disturb the natural ecosystem of many animals are the result of extreme climate changes\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Ensure subject-verb agreement throughout the essay.\", \"Avoid comma splices by using conjunctions or separating independent clauses into distinct sentences.\"]}], \"overall\": 7.0}"}]}

Discuss both views and give your own opinions.\n\nScore this IELTS Task 2 essay according to the rubric, ensuring alignment with the question:\n\nFor some time now, it has become a topic of debate as a section of the society believes that paying excessively to senior most staff of an organization is completely acceptable, whereas others hold a view that this is not fair to the junior workers. In my opinion, I completely agree that a huge compensation to executives should be regarded positively.\n\nOn the one hand, many have valid arguments against higher salaries to executive level employees. First and foremost, everyone in a firm works around 9 hours a day, that is the reason everyone should be paid accordingly. This is because as per the IT markets' standard, employees on each level have to clock atleast 45 hours per week regardless of their positions and Infosys is the prime example of this. Besides this, without any effort of workforce on lower positions, seniors can not drive a company because most of the technical work is done by the juniors and higher level employees just deliver that to clients. Furthermore, employees with less experience have also invested a prodigious amount of money and time to acquire the required experience and educational degree; thus, attractive salaries to seniors is not a fair process followed by companies.\n\nOn the other hand, people who advocate the view that a higher salaries to directors and VPs have certain reasons behind their thinking. Firstly, running a firm smoothly requires a team of workers with extensive experience and knowledge about different industries to deal with numerous international clients and to crack any deal in no time. These senior-most people have been working in different sectors since ages so their experience and work commitments should be compensated with handsome salaries. Besides this, if a director fails at any point of time means the entire organization would suffer. Mahindra Satyam, for example, has a similar story where CFO failed to run the company as a result, lower staff had to suffer as they were terminated. Therefore, I wholeheartedly agree that attractive remuneration to directors is completely fair and the right approach.\n\nTo conclude,  although many still argue that paying excessive salaries to the top-most worker is unfair to juniors, I am completely convinced that this is definitely a fair option as these people are behind running the business properly and due to this the workers on lower positions are earning.\n\nProvide your assessment in the specified JSON format."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"per_criterion\": [{\"name\": \"Task Response\", \"band\": 6.5, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"I completely agree that a huge compensation to executives should be regarded positively.\", \"I wholeheartedly agree that attractive remuneration to directors is completely fair and the right approach.\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"a higher salaries to directors and VPs\", \"type\": \"subject-verb agreement\", \"fix\": \"a higher salary to directors and VPs\"}, {\"span\": \"employees on each level have to clock atleast 45 hours per week\", \"type\": \"factual inaccuracy\", \"fix\": \"employees on each level have to clock at least 40 hours per week\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Provide more balanced arguments for both sides to enhance the depth of the discussion.\", \"Clarify the conclusion by summarizing the main points discussed in the essay.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Coherence & Cohesion\", \"band\": 5.5, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"I completely agree that a huge compensation to executives should be regarded positively.\", \"employees on each level have to clock atleast 45 hours per week regardless of their positions\", \"I wholeheartedly agree that attractive remuneration to directors is completely fair and the right approach.\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"employees on each level have to clock atleast 45 hours per week regardless of their positions\", \"type\": \"inconsistent terminology\", \"fix\": \"Use 'at least' instead of 'atleast' for correct spelling.\"}, {\"span\": \"a higher salaries to directors and VPs\", \"type\": \"subject-verb agreement\", \"fix\": \"Change 'a higher salaries' to 'higher salaries' for grammatical correctness.\"}, {\"span\": \"the workers on lower positions are earning\", \"type\": \"vague reference\", \"fix\": \"Clarify 'the workers on lower positions' to 'junior workers' for better clarity.\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Ensure consistent terminology and correct spelling throughout the essay.\", \"Pay attention to subject-verb agreement to enhance grammatical accuracy.\", \"Use clearer references to avoid vagueness and improve overall clarity.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Lexical Resource\", \"band\": 5.5, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"a huge compensation to executives should be regarded positively\", \"employees on each level have to clock atleast 45 hours per week\", \"attractive salaries to seniors is not a fair process followed by companies\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"a higher salaries to directors\", \"type\": \"number agreement\", \"fix\": \"a higher salary to directors\"}, {\"span\": \"atleast\", \"type\": \"spelling error\", \"fix\": \"at least\"}, {\"span\": \"the top-most worker\", \"type\": \"word choice\", \"fix\": \"the top-level workers\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Use singular forms correctly to ensure subject-verb agreement.\", \"Pay attention to spelling, particularly with commonly used words.\", \"Consider using more varied vocabulary to enhance the richness of the essay.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Grammatical Range & Accuracy\", \"band\": 6.5, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"I completely agree that a huge compensation to executives should be regarded positively.\", \"employees on each level have to clock atleast 45 hours per week regardless of their positions\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"atleast\", \"type\": \"spelling error\", \"fix\": \"at least\"}, {\"span\": \"a higher salaries\", \"type\": \"subject-verb agreement\", \"fix\": \"higher salaries\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Ensure subject-verb agreement is maintained throughout the essay.\", \"Proofread for spelling errors to enhance overall accuracy.\"]}], \"overall\": 6.0}"}]}

However, not every source of data is the truth, there is much disinformation by which ordinary people can be misguided. No doubt that the power of control over informational recourse should be and depends on its spreading and influence on people. \n\nFirstly, there are many online forums, courses and conferences during which person can catch wrong ideas or be deceived by following the pieces of advice that dominate there. For instance, in Russia many poor or even rich people buy various guides in order to be on the lap of luxury. At last, people lose their invested finance, which fluctuate between 1 thousand and several million rubles, time and sometimes even health and accommodation because of the loan on study. \n\nSecondly, such examples show the significance of informational regulation from the government. It can be implemented by installing some restrictions through internet providers, with legal responsibility for disobeying.

Some jobs such as website designers, programmer, that always just sit at their working desk and look to the laptop screen and file paper all their working time, so they usually do not care about the dress that they wear. Secondly, these occupations do not involve meeting customer or partner, therefore, it should be made free for employees as what to wear a comfortable dress to work. \nOn the other hand, numerous people hold the notion that staff should take dressing style into full consideration. These may work in the sectors that require workers to dress up smartly and professional upfront workers like receptionist, teacher, doctor, etc who meet others face-to-face wherein one’s attire may leave either good or bad impressions. In these situations, even though how you present yourself with your fashion preference may not directly affect how you carry out your responsibilities, it could affect social interaction which are

Do you agree or disagree with this statement?\n\nScore this IELTS Task 2 essay according to the rubric, ensuring alignment with the question:\n\nIt is true that large public areas such as squares and parks play a crucial role in all cities. While I believe that this may bring certain benefits, I would argue that it is unnecessary for urban areas to have these spaces. \n\nOn the one hand, there are certain reasons why the metropolis should build public zones. Firstly, the city dwellers reap the benefit of the health of public places. Having open spaces in the metropolis is encouraging residents to engage in extracurricular and recreational activities outdoor, which can help people keep fit and healthy. It is apparent that a park is an ideal place for people to do exercise with others, as a result, it might deter them from potential health risks such as obesity or cardiovascular diseases. Secondly, public areas may boost the development tourism sector because of their attractiveness and beauty. For example Times Square in New York City attracts millions of visitors to the United States annually, therefore, this can contribute to considerable incomes from tourism services. \n\nOn the other hand, I believe that it is difficult for all cities can invest in public places. Due to the shortage of land in some urban areas would curb building parks or squares. For example, Ha Noi, which is a city of Viet Nam, has the limited number of public zones. This is because the large spaces would be allocated for road systems or accommodation to serves densely populated in these. Besides, prolonged public spaces require a lot of cost such as repair, maintenance. It may be the culprit of burden financial for many poor countries, where should pour budget into education, health care services instead of public areas. \n\nIn conclusion, it is necessary for towns

All these things are beneficial for the individuals, however, the impact on the environment as well as the societies should be taken into consideration. \r\n\r\nShipping and delivering tons of products to the shops is harmful to the environment. It would be much beneficial for the natural preservation as well as the local society  if the product would be locally produced. Furthermore, having only international big chains means, that most amount of the income is going straight to the big headquarters of the organizations elsewhere and not to the community. Higher prices, and workforce from abroad result in negative changes in the economic stability of countries. There is a high risk of the local crafts and culture being forgotten thus effecting negatively on the cultural heritage, if all the attention and trends are coming from international markets.

While some believe these experiences have bigger drawbacks than benefits, I would argue the opposite.\n\nTo begin with the negative aspects, the increasing amount of time dedicated by infants to gadgets, especially game consoles, has somewhat reduced how frequently they actually practice any physical activities. This is due to the appeal of beautiful graphics delivered by games and how easily sitting on the couch and immediately starting to have fun with any of their online friends is. For example, in a matter of seconds a player can connect to an online gaming network and play a soccer game. Compare that to actually having to go to a soccer field and manage the schedule of each team member. As a result, their quality of life may be decreased by the lack of time spent exercising and enjoying the outside world.\n\nOn the other hand, I believe content brought by television and games bring a plethora of benefits to youngsters. That audience has the opportunity to learn, without even noticing, huge amounts of information regarding places and events by watching an action movie related to an historical event, such as World War II. Children can also learn a set of useful skills when playing games. For example, management simulators, such as Sim City, can help them better understanding how to handle budget planning and understand the scarcity of money. Consequently, those who learn these skills at earlier ages will certainly be better prepared for the challenges of adult life.\n\nIn conclusion, while there are those who believe children should not dedicate too much time to television and games, due to health related issues, I support that this behavior can be greatly beneficial to them, by broadening their horizons and allowing them to develop useful skills.\n\nProvide your assessment in the specified JSON format."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"per_criterion\": [{\"name\": \"Task Response\", \"band\": 7.5, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"I would argue the opposite.\", \"I believe content brought by television and games bring a plethora of benefits to youngsters.\", \"this behavior can be greatly beneficial to them, by broadening their horizons and allowing them to develop useful skills.\"], \"errors\": [], \"suggestions\": [\"Provide more specific examples or statistics to strengthen the argument regarding the benefits of screen time.\", \"Address potential counterarguments more thoroughly to enhance the depth of the discussion.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Coherence & Cohesion\", \"band\": 6.5, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"the increasing amount of time dedicated by infants to gadgets, especially game consoles, has somewhat reduced how frequently they actually practice any physical activities.\", \"I believe content brought by television and games bring a plethora of benefits to youngsters.\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"the appeal of beautiful graphics delivered by games and how easily sitting on the couch and immediately starting to have fun with any of their online friends is.\", \"type\": \"sentence structure\", \"fix\": \"Rephrase for clarity: 'the appeal of beautiful graphics in games and the ease of sitting on the couch to start having fun with online friends.'\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Use clearer transitions between contrasting ideas to enhance the flow of the essay.\", \"Ensure that each paragraph begins with a topic sentence that clearly states the main idea to improve coherence.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Lexical Resource\", \"band\": 6.5, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"the appeal of beautiful graphics delivered by games\", \"a plethora of benefits to youngsters\", \"a set of useful skills when playing games\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"better understanding how to handle budget planning\", \"type\": \"word form\", \"fix\": \"better understand how to handle budget planning\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Incorporate more varied vocabulary to express similar ideas, such as using synonyms or related terms.\", \"Pay attention to word forms to ensure grammatical accuracy in phrases.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Grammatical Range & Accuracy\", \"band\": 7.5, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"the increasing amount of time dedicated by infants to gadgets\", \"the appeal of beautiful graphics delivered by games\", \"management simulators, such as Sim City, can help them better understanding how to handle budget planning\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"help them better understanding\", \"type\": \"verb form error\", \"fix\": \"help them better understand\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Vary sentence structures more by incorporating complex sentences to enhance the overall range.\", \"Ensure verb forms are consistent and correct, particularly with verbs that follow 'help' or similar constructions.\"]}], \"overall\": 7.0}"}]}

While, other believe that economic revolution is demolishing the environment and should be stopped. In my opinion, economic growth is the better for any country's overall development and it helps to prevent poverty and hunger by generating employment opportunties. I shall discuss both the views further in the subsequent paragraphs.\r\n\r\nTo begin with, some people think that there is only one way left to eradicate the poverty and hunger by doing economic progress. Firstly, economic enhancement creates more jobs for people in the country. Due to this, they can easily afford their expenses and stay away from poverty and hunger. Secondly, profits made by the corporations who are responsible for this financial growth will be converted into the financial benefits to be enjoyed by the straving and needy. \r\n\r\nOn the contrary, there are countless examples to support this view that economic growth results in environmental destruction. To increase the industrialisation in the developing countries, many lowland rainforests have been cleared and plethora of unsustainable agriculture practice introduced to produce cash crops for export. What is more, there are many factories  developing in countries to increase the international trade and it also enhance air pollution, which damages the enviornment at extreme level. For instance, continued use of fossil fuels, which provide energy for growing industrialisation, is causing global warming. It can lead to a rise in sea level, which will make millions of people in Bangladesh homeless.\r\n\r\nTo recapitulate, i would like to opine that economic growth must not be stopped unless, it is based on damaging the environment.\n\nProvide your assessment in the specified JSON format."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"per_criterion\": [{\"name\": \"Task Response\", \"band\": 5.0, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"economic growth is the better for any country's overall development\", \"economic enhancement creates more jobs for people in the country\", \"economic growth results in environmental destruction\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"the only solution to eliminate world's poverty and hunger\", \"type\": \"lack of clarity\", \"fix\": \"clarify that economic development is one of several solutions to poverty and hunger\"}, {\"span\": \"economic growth is the better for any country's overall development\", \"type\": \"grammatical error\", \"fix\": \"change to 'economic growth is better for any country's overall development'\"}, {\"span\": \"i would like to opine that economic growth must not be stopped unless, it is based on damaging the environment\", \"type\": \"incomplete argument\", \"fix\": \"provide a clearer conclusion that summarizes the discussion and states a balanced view\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Ensure that all arguments are clearly developed and supported with examples.\", \"Use more precise language to express opinions and avoid vague statements.\", \"Conclude with a summary that reflects the complexity of the issue rather than a one-sided view.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Coherence & Cohesion\", \"band\": 4.0, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"economic growth is the better for any country's overall development\", \"there is only one way left to eradicate the poverty and hunger by doing economic progress\", \"economic growth results in environmental destruction\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"economic growth is the better for any country's overall development\", \"type\": \"clarity issue\", \"fix\": \"Rephrase to 'economic growth is better for a country's overall development'\"}, {\"span\": \"there is only one way left to eradicate the poverty and hunger\", \"type\": \"article usage error\", \"fix\": \"Change to 'to eradicate poverty and hunger'\"}, {\"span\": \"it is based on damaging the environment\", \"type\": \"clarity issue\", \"fix\": \"Rephrase to 'unless it does not damage the environment'\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Use clearer transitions between ideas to enhance the flow of the essay.\", \"Ensure consistent use of articles and plural forms to improve grammatical accuracy.\", \"Clarify the conclusion to better summarize the main argument and avoid ambiguity.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Lexical Resource\", \"band\": 4.0, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"economic development is the only solution to eliminate world's poverty and hunger\", \"economic growth is the better for any country's overall development\", \"economic enhancement creates more jobs for people in the country\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"opportunties\", \"type\": \"spelling error\", \"fix\": \"opportunities\"}, {\"span\": \"straving\", \"type\": \"spelling error\", \"fix\": \"starving\"}, {\"span\": \"enviornment\", \"type\": \"spelling error\", \"fix\": \"environment\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Use a wider range of vocabulary to express ideas more precisely.\", \"Avoid repetitive phrases and consider synonyms to enhance lexical variety.\", \"Pay attention to spelling to improve overall clarity and professionalism of the essay.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Grammatical Range & Accuracy\", \"band\": 5.0, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"economic growth is the better for any country's overall development\", \"economic enhancement creates more jobs for people in the country\", \"there are countless examples to support this view that economic growth results in environmental destruction\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"the better for any country's overall development\", \"type\": \"article usage\", \"fix\": \"the better option for any country's overall development\"}, {\"span\": \"opportunties\", \"type\": \"spelling error\", \"fix\": \"opportunities\"}, {\"span\": \"straving\", \"type\": \"spelling error\", \"fix\": \"starving\"}, {\"span\": \"it also enhance air pollution\", \"type\": \"subject-verb agreement\", \"fix\": \"it also enhances air pollution\"}, {\"span\": \"i would like to opine\", \"type\": \"capitalization\", \"fix\": \"I would like to opine\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Pay attention to subject-verb agreement to ensure consistency in your sentences.\", \"Proofread your essay to correct spelling errors before submission.\", \"Use articles appropriately to enhance clarity and grammatical accuracy.\"]}], \"overall\": 4.5}"}]}

Unfortunately, not all of us have a financial opportunity to live in a modern high- tech world. When some people think, that technology make a gap between rich and poor humans, other think it cause the opposite effect. In this essay I will discuss both opinions and try to find a right view.\r\n\r\n   With the developing of technology our everyday's life becom more digital and a lot of modern devices are available. Therefore, our life is changing. For example, we use digitalisation on our workspaces and in our homes in order to make lifes much easier. In addition, our habbits, flavors, and goals are chaining as well.    Majority of people living under the poverty line, however, still does not have an opportunity to use all modern  devices due to its cost, so their life is much different. That may be a cause of the increasing the gap between rich and poor people.\r\n\r\n   At the same time, digitalisation makes lots of opportunities for poor people to communicate with those, who are rich.  There are many examples, how an asking for help, job search, and even finding a soul mate has spread and been successful due to  the Internet. So, in these cases, technology constricts the gap between people of different social backgrounds. Futhermore, most of the an available for poverty- stricken persons devices help to understand what does rich life looks like, what do rich people dream and interest about. That is why I am convinced, technology binds all mankind together.\r\n\r\n   In conclusion, technological progress has huge impact on our lifes, although it does not separate people.

Idleness is not only bad to an individual but it is also bad to the community.

This would result to a community with people who are dangerous to themselves as well as to other society members. \r\n\r\nMoreover, teenagers acquire knowledge and skills when they volunteer during their leisure time.

To what extent do you agree or disagree?\n\nScore this IELTS Task 2 essay according to the rubric, ensuring alignment with the question:\n\nIt is sometimes argued that the main approach of education is leading children to become well-behaved citizens, rather than to bring them benefits as individuals. In my opinion, I totally agree with that viewpoint because of some reasons that I will mention in this essay.\r\n\r\nFirst and foremost, the initial aim of schools is to help children with academic knowledge, and then make them  become beneficial to society. Almost the time that students spend at school is for learning logical and social subjects which are crucial to cultivating their thinking and behaviour in society in the future. Moreover, this knowledge may be practical in work and help them to get more achievement in their career paths. For example, governments put Physics as a compulsory subject in the education system in each country to improve their learning for students who want to become researchers and engineers and move up the career ladder in the future.\r\n\r\nSecondly, benefiting students may make them more selfish and self-important in many ways. This means students could be paid more attention at school. However, catering to pupils a lot can bring the sense of being right in most situations, and they may have bad behaviour to improve their opinion. For instance, to protect their opinion, some students may have violence and have some wrong methods to change others' thinking. Meanwhile, teachers may allocate more time to look after their students and may have some difficulty changing their teaching method due to justifying students' actions if they have any bad behaviour in the education area.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, I concur that school is the most suitable place where children could study academic information to get success in both career and social fields, instead of benefiting them as they desire. In addition, parents can become their children's partners with the support from schools to help them to acquire more knowledge and not to overprotect them. Thus, they can become good individuals in the future.\n\nProvide your assessment in the specified JSON format."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"per_criterion\": [{\"name\": \"Task Response\", \"band\": 6.5, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"I totally agree with that viewpoint because of some reasons that I will mention in this essay.\", \"the initial aim of schools is to help children with academic knowledge, and then make them become beneficial to society.\", \"I concur that school is the most suitable place where children could study academic information to get success in both career and social fields\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"benefiting students may make them more selfish and self-important\", \"type\": \"clarity\", \"fix\": \"clarify how benefiting students leads to selfishness\"}, {\"span\": \"catering to pupils a lot can bring the sense of being right in most situations\", \"type\": \"clarity\", \"fix\": \"explain what 'catering' means in this context\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Provide clearer explanations and examples to support the argument about the negative effects of benefiting students.\", \"Ensure that all points made in the essay directly relate back to the main argument to enhance coherence.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Coherence & Cohesion\", \"band\": 5.5, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"the initial aim of schools is to help children with academic knowledge, and then make them become beneficial to society\", \"this knowledge may be practical in work and help them to get more achievement in their career paths\", \"school is the most suitable place where children could study academic information to get success in both career and social fields\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"catering to pupils a lot can bring the sense of being right in most situations\", \"type\": \"clarity and coherence\", \"fix\": \"Rephrase to clarify the meaning, e.g., 'Overly catering to pupils can lead them to believe they are always right.'\"}, {\"span\": \"may have some difficulty changing their teaching method due to justifying students' actions if they have any bad behaviour in the education area\", \"type\": \"sentence structure\", \"fix\": \"Simplify the sentence for better clarity, e.g., 'Teachers may struggle to change their teaching methods if they need to justify students' bad behavior.'\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Use clearer transitions between ideas to enhance the flow of the essay.\", \"Avoid overly complex sentences that may confuse the reader; aim for simplicity and clarity.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Lexical Resource\", \"band\": 5.5, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"the initial aim of schools is to help children with academic knowledge\", \"catering to pupils a lot can bring the sense of being right in most situations\", \"school is the most suitable place where children could study academic information\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"beneficial to society\", \"type\": \"word choice\", \"fix\": \"beneficial members of society\"}, {\"span\": \"may have bad behaviour to improve their opinion\", \"type\": \"collocation\", \"fix\": \"may exhibit bad behavior to defend their opinion\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Use more varied vocabulary to express ideas, avoiding repetition of common phrases.\", \"Pay attention to collocations and word choices to ensure they convey the intended meaning accurately.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Grammatical Range & Accuracy\", \"band\": 6.5, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"the initial aim of schools is to help children with academic knowledge, and then make them become beneficial to society.\", \"this knowledge may be practical in work and help them to get more achievement in their career paths.\", \"I concur that school is the most suitable place where children could study academic information to get success in both career and social fields.\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"students could be paid more attention at school\", \"type\": \"subject-verb agreement\", \"fix\": \"students could receive more attention at school\"}, {\"span\": \"catering to pupils a lot can bring the sense of being right in most situations\", \"type\": \"awkward phrasing\", \"fix\": \"catering excessively to pupils can create a sense of entitlement in most situations\"}, {\"span\": \"may have some difficulty changing their teaching method due to justifying students' actions if they have any bad behaviour in the education area\", \"type\": \"wordiness\", \"fix\": \"may have difficulty changing their teaching methods to justify students' actions if they exhibit bad behaviour\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Use more varied sentence structures to enhance grammatical range.\", \"Avoid awkward phrasing by simplifying complex sentences.\", \"Ensure subject-verb agreement is maintained throughout the essay.\"]}], \"overall\": 6.0}"}]}

Why is this? Do you think it is a positive or negative development?\n\nScore this IELTS Task 2 essay according to the rubric, ensuring alignment with the question:\n\nIn our modern society, many things which may have taken our parents hours, or even days, to complete, we expect to be achieved with near instant speed. The causes of this shift are driven by a growing scarcity of free time, created by longer work hours and a wider range of tasks to complete. I believe that this expectation for things to be completed rapidly is not necessarily a bad thing, however the reasons why we expect them to be done quickly is.\n\nThe main reason for why we expect things to occur in a short timespan is that people work longer hours, making their spare time scarcer. Additional hours spent at work mean there are fewer available to accomplish personal tasks, driving a preference for faster completion. For example, it is normal in many jobs for one to work beyond the standard 37 hour work week. I usually work from 40 to 60 hours each week. With fewer hours to spend waiting for services to be completed, or to receive information updates, we, as a people, tend to select speed over most else. This drive for expediency created by time poverty definitely seems like a negative byproduct of our busy lives.\n\nIn addition to having less personal time, it seems that people have more things to do in general. Our modern lives carry all of the demands of the previous generation, however there are now also social media, fitness classes, taking children to multiple activities, etc. Given that we have more tasks to complete in less time, the expectation is that these items should be done faster, otherwise one is faced with a mathematical impossibility. Leading busier lives combined with less free time leads to an expectation for tasks to be done as quickly as possible, in order to make time for those tasks which are enjoyable. Unlike the issue of longer work hours, however, the amount of tasks to complete can be pared down if we wisely prioritise what really matters in our lives.\n\nAs a modern society, we have grown to expect certain services, information and tasks to be completed near instantly. The reasons why we expect this rapid task completion, however, are definitely negative, as they stem from an increasing number of priorities competing for fewer leisure hours. I believe that while it is good that certain services can be completed quickly, we should look at where our priorities lie, and attempt to balance our work lives with our personal lives more effectively.\n\nProvide your assessment in the specified JSON format."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"per_criterion\": [{\"name\": \"Task Response\", \"band\": 6.5, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"the expectation for things to be completed rapidly is not necessarily a bad thing\", \"the expectation is that these items should be done faster, otherwise one is faced with a mathematical impossibility\", \"we should look at where our priorities lie, and attempt to balance our work lives with our personal lives more effectively\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"the reasons why we expect them to be done quickly is\", \"type\": \"clarity of argument\", \"fix\": \"clarify the reasons for the negative expectation\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Provide clearer examples or evidence to support the claim that rapid task completion has negative consequences.\", \"Ensure that the conclusion effectively summarizes the main points and reinforces the argument made throughout the essay.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Coherence & Cohesion\", \"band\": 5.5, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"the expectation for things to be completed rapidly is not necessarily a bad thing, however the reasons why we expect them to be done quickly is.\", \"Leading busier lives combined with less free time leads to an expectation for tasks to be done as quickly as possible\", \"the reasons why we expect this rapid task completion, however, are definitely negative\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"the expectation for things to be completed rapidly is not necessarily a bad thing, however the reasons why we expect them to be done quickly is.\", \"type\": \"grammatical error\", \"fix\": \"Change 'is' to 'are' to agree with the plural subject 'reasons'.\"}, {\"span\": \"we, as a people, tend to select speed over most else.\", \"type\": \"awkward phrasing\", \"fix\": \"Rephrase to 'we tend to prioritize speed over other factors.'\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Use clearer topic sentences to guide the reader through each paragraph's main idea.\", \"Ensure subject-verb agreement throughout the essay to enhance grammatical accuracy.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Lexical Resource\", \"band\": 5.5, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"the expectation for things to be completed rapidly is not necessarily a bad thing\", \"this drive for expediency created by time poverty definitely seems like a negative byproduct of our busy lives\", \"the expectation is that these items should be done faster, otherwise one is faced with a mathematical impossibility\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"the expectation is that these items should be done faster\", \"type\": \"word choice\", \"fix\": \"the expectation is that these items should be completed faster\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Incorporate a wider range of vocabulary to express ideas more precisely.\", \"Avoid repetitive phrases and consider using synonyms to enhance lexical variety.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Grammatical Range & Accuracy\", \"band\": 6.5, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"the expectation for things to be completed rapidly is not necessarily a bad thing\", \"the expectation is that these items should be done faster\", \"we should look at where our priorities lie\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"the reasons why we expect them to be done quickly is\", \"type\": \"subject-verb agreement\", \"fix\": \"the reasons why we expect them to be done quickly are\"}, {\"span\": \"the amount of tasks to complete can be pared down\", \"type\": \"word choice\", \"fix\": \"the number of tasks to complete can be pared down\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Ensure subject-verb agreement is maintained throughout the essay.\", \"Use 'number' instead of 'amount' when referring to countable nouns like 'tasks'.\"]}], \"overall\": 6.0}"}]}

This is the most important cause of the high volume of traffic.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThis issue should be tackled by the government in terms of improving the public transportation infrastructure such as increasing the sky train line, adding the number of buses during rush hour or reducing fee costs. This might persuade people to use public transportation more. For instance, according to the latest news, the number of people who use the new sky train line instead of their personal cars is increasing, accounting for 80% since open service. Therefore, improving public transportation infrastructure by the government could reduce traffic problems in some cities or towns.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nThe most significant reason for the congestion problem is not enough public transport facilities, so the government should  tackle this problem by upgrading public transportation services.\n\nProvide your assessment in the specified JSON format."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"per_criterion\": [{\"name\": \"Task Response\", \"band\": 7.0, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"the congestion issues are likely to be seen in a large town or in the Center Business District of some capital cities.\", \"This issue should be tackled by the government in terms of improving the public transportation infrastructure\", \"the government should tackle this problem by upgrading public transportation services.\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"the solution which should be done\", \"type\": \"clarity\", \"fix\": \"the solutions that should be implemented\"}, {\"span\": \"the deficient public transport system in order to support inhabitants sufficiently\", \"type\": \"clarity\", \"fix\": \"the deficient public transport system that does not sufficiently support inhabitants\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Clarify the solutions by providing specific examples of successful public transport improvements in other cities.\", \"Ensure that the introduction clearly outlines the main points that will be discussed in the essay.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Coherence & Cohesion\", \"band\": 6.0, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"the congestion issues are likely to be seen in a large town or in the Center Business District of some capital cities.\", \"improving public transportation infrastructure by the government could reduce traffic problems in some cities or towns.\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"the solution which should be done, including the following ,examples will be provided to support my point of view.\", \"type\": \"punctuation and clarity\", \"fix\": \"Remove the comma before 'examples' and clarify the phrase for better readability.\"}, {\"span\": \"the deficient public transport system in order to support inhabitants sufficiently\", \"type\": \"wordiness\", \"fix\": \"Simplify to 'the inadequate public transport system to sufficiently support inhabitants.'\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Use clearer transitions between ideas to enhance the flow of the essay.\", \"Avoid redundancy by combining similar ideas into single sentences for conciseness.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Lexical Resource\", \"band\": 6.0, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"the congestion problem, especially in big cities at present\", \"the deficient public transport system in order to support inhabitants sufficiently\", \"improving the public transportation infrastructure\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"the solution which should be done\", \"type\": \"word choice\", \"fix\": \"the solution that should be implemented\"}, {\"span\": \"the Center Business District\", \"type\": \"capitalization\", \"fix\": \"the Central Business District\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Use more varied vocabulary to express ideas, such as synonyms for 'important' and 'problem'.\", \"Ensure proper capitalization for specific terms and phrases to enhance clarity and professionalism.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Grammatical Range & Accuracy\", \"band\": 7.0, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"the congestion issues are likely to be seen in a large town or in the Center Business District of some capital cities.\", \"improving public transportation infrastructure by the government could reduce traffic problems in some cities or towns.\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"the solution which should be done\", \"type\": \"word choice\", \"fix\": \"the solution that should be implemented\"}, {\"span\": \"the deficient public transport system in order to support inhabitants sufficiently\", \"type\": \"awkward phrasing\", \"fix\": \"the deficient public transport system that does not sufficiently support inhabitants\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Use more varied sentence structures to enhance the overall complexity of the writing.\", \"Ensure clarity by avoiding awkward phrasing and using more precise language.\"]}], \"overall\": 6.5}"}]}

Other people think that this is wrong and that it is a waste of money.\nDiscuss both views and give your own opinion.\n\nScore this IELTS Task 2 essay according to the rubric, ensuring alignment with the question:\n\nFew people believe that children should be given some money as a weekly allowance to spend as they wish, and others prefer not to do it, thinking that it is not fruitful.\n\nWhen we hand over money to children, we make them realize the importance of expenditure and savings at an early stage of life, which will be very helpful for them as they grow old. For instance, my neighbour follows this practice and give 5 dollars per week to her child. I remember, there was a time when she wanted an expensive toy, and had to save her pocket money for 1 year in order to get it. This way not only she learnt about savings, but she also understood, which items are worth spending on.\n\nHowever, providing money to children can sometimes be the cause of major problems, as the parents have no control over how the child will use it. For example, one of my friend’s son used the money he received to impress others in his school, and spent it on the items he can show-off, like the latest toy or buying expensive dessert. This increased peer pressure on the poor students of his class who started demanding money from their parents as well. This is not a favourable situation for the poor family as they barely have the money to raise their kids.\n\nIn conclusion, my opinion is that money should not be handed to children to make expenses on their own. Rather, it is a better idea to keep their spendings under adult supervision, so that we can guide them about the positives and negatives of their spendings. I do not think it is a wise decision to give weekly allowance to kids.\n\nProvide your assessment in the specified JSON format."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"per_criterion\": [{\"name\": \"Coherence & Cohesion\", \"band\": 7.0, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"When we hand over money to children, we make them realize the importance of expenditure and savings at an early stage of life\", \"providing money to children can sometimes be the cause of major problems\", \"money should not be handed to children to make expenses on their own\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"my neighbour follows this practice and give 5 dollars per week\", \"type\": \"subject-verb agreement\", \"fix\": \"my neighbour follows this practice and gives 5 dollars per week\"}, {\"span\": \"one of my friend’s son\", \"type\": \"possessive error\", \"fix\": \"one of my friends’ sons\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Ensure subject-verb agreement throughout the essay for grammatical accuracy.\", \"Use consistent possessive forms to avoid confusion, especially when referring to multiple subjects.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Task Response\", \"band\": 8.0, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"we make them realize the importance of expenditure and savings at an early stage of life\", \"money should not be handed to children to make expenses on their own\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"my neighbour follows this practice and give 5 dollars per week\", \"type\": \"subject-verb agreement\", \"fix\": \"my neighbour follows this practice and gives 5 dollars per week\"}, {\"span\": \"one of my friend’s son\", \"type\": \"possessive error\", \"fix\": \"one of my friends' sons\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Provide a more balanced view by discussing potential benefits of giving allowances alongside the drawbacks.\", \"Clarify the conclusion by summarizing the main arguments presented in the essay.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Lexical Resource\", \"band\": 7.0, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"we make them realize the importance of expenditure and savings at an early stage of life\", \"providing money to children can sometimes be the cause of major problems\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"my neighbour follows this practice and give 5 dollars per week\", \"type\": \"subject-verb agreement\", \"fix\": \"my neighbour follows this practice and gives 5 dollars per week\"}, {\"span\": \"one of my friend’s son\", \"type\": \"possessive form\", \"fix\": \"one of my friends' sons\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Use more varied vocabulary to express ideas, such as synonyms for 'money' or 'spending'.\", \"Ensure subject-verb agreement is maintained throughout the essay.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Grammatical Range & Accuracy\", \"band\": 7.0, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"we make them realize the importance of expenditure and savings at an early stage of life\", \"providing money to children can sometimes be the cause of major problems\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"my neighbour follows this practice and give 5 dollars per week\", \"type\": \"subject-verb agreement\", \"fix\": \"my neighbour follows this practice and gives 5 dollars per week\"}, {\"span\": \"one of my friend’s son used the money he received\", \"type\": \"possessive error\", \"fix\": \"one of my friend's sons used the money he received\"}, {\"span\": \"which items are worth spending on\", \"type\": \"awkward phrasing\", \"fix\": \"which items are worth spending money on\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Ensure subject-verb agreement is maintained throughout the essay.\", \"Use correct possessive forms to avoid confusion.\", \"Consider rephrasing awkward sentences for better clarity and flow.\"]}], \"overall\": 7.5}"}]}

I completely agree with the opinion and believe that climate change can be solved by using less-packaging product and taking public transport. \n\nUsing sustainable-packaging product is one of the major movements applied to deal with that, reducing the amount of greenhouse gases added to the atmosphere. This is because the less waste raw material used. For example, since 2019, some cafes in Indonesia have implemented paper cups made of recyclable material and compostable one for replacing the use of plastic, and it has been proven successfully declining the number of carbon footprint in the country, leading to prevent the climate change.\n\nFurthermore, the use of public transportation tends to give tremendous impact on battling against climate change, giving a great impact to increase environmentally friendly condition.

In my opinion, although these solutions would be helpful, it is more important to prioritize proper nutrition.\r\n\r\nOn the one hand, there are current issues concerning housing and the environment that impact health. Many illnesses and conditions are either directly or indirectly related to one’s environment. For instance, a person who lives in an overcrowded metropolis such as Hanoi or Beijing must deal on a daily basis with the immediate dangers of air pollution, potential drinking water contamination, car accidents, and elevated crimes rates. If there were fewer individuals in these cities and the air was cleaner because there were more open, green areas, then it is probable that hospitals would be able to focus more on a reduced number of patients.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, there are various causes for diseases and the primary one is poor nutrition. In the last several decades, lifespans globally have increased exponentially, largely as a result of advances in medical science and greater understanding of the human body. A standout example of this would be the plant-based diets that are widely recommended by most nutritionists. A person who consumes little meat, reduces their carbohydrate intake, and mostly does not eat sugar will drastically lower the risk of conditions ranging from diabetes and heart disease to Alzheimer’s and cancer. National health authorities can widely and effectively address these health problems by legislating the levels of unhealthy ingredients in food products.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, those in favor of combatting housing and environmental problems make legitimate arguments though improving the average citizen’s diet is in fact the best guarantee of good health.

To what extent do you agree or disagree?\n\nScore this IELTS Task 2 essay according to the rubric, ensuring alignment with the question:\n\nParents want their children to succeed in life and as a result, they always motivate their children to spend more time in physical activities, such as sports and yoga, as compared to studying. Physical activities do have their obvious advantages but in my opinion, studying is equally important and the following arguments will prove this.\r\n\r\nThere are countless advantages of physical activities which include but are not limited to sports, yoga, meditation and dance. First and foremost, these activities increase endurance and stamina, and improve blood and oxygen flow which in turn, increase the body's strength and mental focus. Moreover, consistently exercising these activities on regular basis boosts immunity and eliminates the cause of common diseases such as diabetes, blood pressure and many more. Furthermore, bodily chemical fluids released are essential for the body's functioning. For instance, melatonin is responsible for inducing sleep and not doing any physical tasks is the root cause of insomnia.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, education is equally important. Being able to read, write and comprehend solves most of the daily problems one encounter and additionally, it makes you astute and improves your problem-solving ability. Moreover, it boosts one's self-confidence and adds to one's personality. For example, imagine a renowned athlete struggling to speak in front of media reporters. Lastly, in my opinion, being able to educate oneself and have the financial freedom to pursue studies in a field of one's choice is a privilege and everyone should leverage it to its maximum as it does not harm in any way and is always a cherry on the cake.\r\n\r\nTo summarise, the importance of physical activities is at par with book education.

While there are some benefits to students getting a job straight, I believe that keep going to university or college is the best path to finding a satisfying career. In this essay, I will explain both sides in detail in the ensuing paragraphs.\n\nAdolescents getting a career directly after high school is attractive for several reasons. Firstly, a university degree is not necessary for some industries. In Taiwan, for example, there are a few managers for service professions who assume practical training is more important. In addition, these youth would gain more work experience, become more independent, and even start earning money sooner than other peers who are students.\n\nOn the other hand, I completely agree that it is more beneficial to young people for continuing their programs at university. The major reason is a degree can open the door to better employment prospects. For instance, most jobs, such as medical professions or engineering require academic qualifications, including specific knowledge and skills.

As far as I am concerned, there are two reasons that prove not only increasing the cost of fuel is affectless but also  can be damage for family financial. The illustration of these reasons is provided   below.\r\n\r\nThe primary negative point to take into account is family finance. There are many jobs that   require to use of personal transportation vehicles. When   the   cost of   fuel   is   increased  , people for the most probability  will be faced with financial difficulty.\r\n\r\n It can be further claimed that when people struggle against  poverty and they cannot provide daily needs so in this situation they never pay attention to the care of the environment . An example that will clarify the point is taxi drivers. The chief part of their job depends on cost of fuel so the high cost can be made it a hard condition for them.\r\n\r\nThe second substantial reason for the current discussion is the entertainment industry and tourism .In other words, a high percentage of travel is done with a personal vehicle. If people cannot purchase the fuel for their necessary needs perhaps they will   put    away unimportant expenses like travelling. For instance, there are many persons who  get  lower salaries than others like employees. They oblige to manage their income and spend most of their salary on essential requirements. So they will put travel in last preference. In this case, the tourism industry likely will experience high losses \r\n\r\nIn conclusion, there are various  solutions for solving the environmental crisis   But, it seems to me that enhancing the transportations cost like fuel is not logical and sensible.

Is it a positive or negative development?\n\nScore this IELTS Task 2 essay according to the rubric, ensuring alignment with the question:\n\nToday, more and more people are moving toward the urban areas from villages, which causes the population of cities to grow too high. Due to the limited amount of land, many city dwellers have to live in a house with small or no backyards, specifically apartments. The fact that there are more and more high-rise apartment buildings is a result of this phenomenon. In my opinion, this development has two sides, and the below essay will give explanations for my viewpoint.\r\n\r\nOn the one hand, there are a couple of positive aspects. Firstly, building many apartment buildings helps solve the population problem in big cities. An apartment building can accommodate at least 500 people, whereas a house can not meet that. For instance, in Ho Chi Minh City, apartment buildings have solved the housing problem for 47 per cent of the dwellers. Secondly, living in an apartment helps us avoid noise and air pollution. The health of people who live near streets will be badly affected by emissions and noise from vehicles, on the contrary, those living in apartments will not be affected by traffic.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, those living in apartments will have to pay different fees, such as security, cleaning and parking fees. This increases the cost of living for many families. For example, in Ho Chi Minh City, apartment dwellers have a 30 per cent higher cost of living than homeowners. Furthermore, if you want to open a party with more than 10 people, you must ask permission from the apartment management.\r\n\r\nTo conclude,  according to the arguments aforementioned above, more and more people living in a house with small or no outdoor areas is a great development.

It’s very important to save the cultural heritage of the place we live in or if it’s old buildings or houses we can recreate them without changing any of the original touches.

Unfortunately, this will encourage them to come back and get others with them. Moreover, this will increase the outcome, and thus the government can enhance the quality of tourism. However, different ways are used to search for information regarding a building’s history. Such details can be obtained from the town’s local library, where old archives are kept and surely reliable. Moreover, Online websites can be a way to learn more about the historic facts wanted. Furthermore, asking the elderly can give the data needed about the old days. For example, it is often the oldest community members who know the past more than the others as they may have been alive when some historic events happened.\r\n\r\nTo conclude, it is easy for people to search for their history by just keeping them.

As In Vadodara city some oldest houses will be  like maharaja sayaji Rao's house;  However, In some old ,house there were some archaeological things for example old coin or old currency and using their oldest currency give the highest value.  Referring, to the second question people also can carry out research on this subject because  its subject gives classical knowledge about the house and other buildings. Such as in the oldest year how  Individuals use raw materials for making bracks. and bracks are very strong compared to the new one.  Furthermore human beings also know about the oldest things and give their specific knowledge to their  child for increased interest in  knowing history subjects. For ,example children also know about history of India because of their knowledge become made u pride person of India.  All in all, the interest in finding out  the history of their house is also useful and also continue  with research into a historical subject; However, some people are also interested to find out about history and  knowing the history of  different subjects. It gives extra knowledge about some things, that you want to  know. I agree with the second question\n\nProvide your assessment in the specified JSON format."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"per_criterion\": [{\"name\": \"Task Response\", \"band\": 4.5, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"there are many reasons for the finding out the history of the house they are stay in\", \"the interest in finding out the history of their house is also useful\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"few nations higher individuals are becoming interested\", \"type\": \"clarity\", \"fix\": \"few nations' individuals are becoming interested\"}, {\"span\": \"the finding out the history of the house they are stay in?\", \"type\": \"grammar\", \"fix\": \"finding out the history of the house they are staying in.\"}, {\"span\": \"give their specific knowledge to their child for increased interest\", \"type\": \"clarity\", \"fix\": \"give their specific knowledge to their children to increase interest\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Clarify the main points and structure the essay more logically to enhance understanding.\", \"Use more precise language and correct grammatical errors to improve clarity.\", \"Provide specific examples or evidence to support claims about the importance of historical knowledge.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Coherence & Cohesion\", \"band\": 3.5, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"the interest in finding out the history of their house is also useful and also continue with research into a historical subject\", \"children also know about history of India because of their knowledge become made u pride person of India\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"the house they are living in for there are several reasons for this think\", \"type\": \"sentence structure\", \"fix\": \"the house they are living in, as there are several reasons for this\"}, {\"span\": \"there are many reasons for the finding out the history of the house they are stay in?\", \"type\": \"question formation\", \"fix\": \"there are many reasons for finding out the history of the house they are staying in.\"}, {\"span\": \"and bracks are very strong compared to the new one.\", \"type\": \"word choice\", \"fix\": \"and bricks are much stronger compared to the new ones.\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Use clearer transitions between ideas to improve the flow of the essay.\", \"Ensure proper sentence structure and grammar to enhance readability.\", \"Avoid repetition and clarify ambiguous phrases to strengthen coherence.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Lexical Resource\", \"band\": 3.5, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"the oldest house is very much given value as a classical house\", \"its subject gives classical knowledge about the house and other buildings\", \"the interest in finding out the history of their house is also useful\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"few nations higher individuals are becoming interested\", \"type\": \"word choice\", \"fix\": \"few nations' individuals are becoming more interested\"}, {\"span\": \"the finding out the history of the house they are stay in\", \"type\": \"grammatical error\", \"fix\": \"finding out the history of the house they are staying in\"}, {\"span\": \"give their specific knowledge to their child for increased interest\", \"type\": \"word form\", \"fix\": \"give their specific knowledge to their children to increase interest\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Use more precise vocabulary to convey ideas clearly and accurately.\", \"Avoid repetitive phrases and improve sentence structure for better coherence.\", \"Focus on grammatical accuracy, especially with verb forms and plurals.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Grammatical Range & Accuracy\", \"band\": 4.5, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"there are many reasons for the finding out the history of the house they are stay in\", \"the interest in finding out the history of their house is also useful\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"the finding out the history of the house they are stay in\", \"type\": \"verb form error\", \"fix\": \"the finding out of the history of the house they are staying in\"}, {\"span\": \"the oldest house is very much given value as a classical house\", \"type\": \"awkward phrasing\", \"fix\": \"the oldest houses are highly valued as classical houses\"}, {\"span\": \"their knowledge become made u pride person of India\", \"type\": \"subject-verb agreement error\", \"fix\": \"their knowledge makes them proud individuals of India\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Improve sentence structure to enhance clarity and coherence.\", \"Use more varied sentence types and tenses to demonstrate grammatical range.\", \"Pay attention to subject-verb agreement and correct verb forms.\"]}], \"overall\": 4.0}"}]}

There have been polarised views, whether its benefits outweigh the drawbacks. In my opinion, it has more demerits than merits.\n\nLate parenthood is froth with lots of  disadvantages. Firstly, fathers and mothers who are elderly whereas their children are still little encounter difficulties catering for and  bringing them up. This is because at late middle age to old age, the body is degenerating and becoming weaker. These parents are unable to hustle to make money for their children's education. They also lack strength to discipline their children when necessary. A good example is my neighbour  and wife, who started having babies in their middle fiftys. At 70 years the first son was just entering secondary school. It was difficult for them to combine age related illnesses and fending for their children.   As a result, these children grew as if they had no parents. They were not disciplined and ended up criminals.\n\nAnother downside to it is the fact that most children of geriatric parents become orphans pretty early in their childhood. In fact studies by social workers showed that 80% of children in the orphanage are born of parents who started having babies at their late middle age. These elderly parents die from natural course of aging, leaving their little children behind. These and lots more are the disadvantages of late parenthood. \n\nIn conclusion, though it is becoming a more popular decision among people to have children in later age, it is not a good idea because it has lots of negatives  far more than the positives\n\nProvide your assessment in the specified JSON format."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"per_criterion\": [{\"name\": \"Task Response\", \"band\": 6.0, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"in my opinion, it has more demerits than merits.\", \"these children grew as if they had no parents.\", \"it is not a good idea because it has lots of negatives far more than the positives\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"whether its benefits outweigh the drawbacks\", \"type\": \"clarity\", \"fix\": \"should be 'whether its benefits outweigh the drawbacks.'\"}, {\"span\": \"Late parenthood is froth with lots of disadvantages.\", \"type\": \"word choice\", \"fix\": \"should be 'Late parenthood is fraught with lots of disadvantages.'\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Provide a more balanced view by discussing some potential benefits of late parenthood.\", \"Use more specific examples or data to support claims about the disadvantages.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Coherence & Cohesion\", \"band\": 5.0, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"Late parenthood is froth with lots of disadvantages.\", \"These parents are unable to hustle to make money for their children's education.\", \"In conclusion, though it is becoming a more popular decision among people to have children in later age, it is not a good idea because it has lots of negatives far more than the positives.\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"Late parenthood is froth with lots of disadvantages.\", \"type\": \"word choice\", \"fix\": \"Replace 'froth' with 'fraught'\"}, {\"span\": \"At 70 years the first son was just entering secondary school.\", \"type\": \"cohesion\", \"fix\": \"Clarify the timeline by rephrasing to 'By the age of 70, their first son was just entering secondary school.'\"}, {\"span\": \"These and lots more are the disadvantages of late parenthood.\", \"type\": \"clarity\", \"fix\": \"Rephrase to 'These are just some of the many disadvantages of late parenthood.'\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Use clearer transitions between ideas to enhance the flow of the essay.\", \"Ensure that word choices accurately convey the intended meaning, such as using 'fraught' instead of 'froth'.\", \"Provide more specific examples or evidence to support claims made about the disadvantages of late parenthood.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Lexical Resource\", \"band\": 5.0, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"Late parenthood is froth with lots of disadvantages.\", \"These parents are unable to hustle to make money for their children's education.\", \"It is not a good idea because it has lots of negatives far more than the positives.\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"froth with lots of disadvantages\", \"type\": \"word choice\", \"fix\": \"fraught with lots of disadvantages\"}, {\"span\": \"middle fiftys\", \"type\": \"spelling\", \"fix\": \"middle fifties\"}, {\"span\": \"natural course of aging\", \"type\": \"word choice\", \"fix\": \"natural process of aging\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Use more precise vocabulary to enhance clarity and avoid ambiguity.\", \"Pay attention to spelling and grammatical forms, especially with plural nouns.\", \"Incorporate a wider range of synonyms to avoid repetition and improve lexical variety.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Grammatical Range & Accuracy\", \"band\": 6.0, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"Late parenthood is froth with lots of disadvantages.\", \"These parents are unable to hustle to make money for their children's education.\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"its benefits outweigh the drawbacks\", \"type\": \"subject-verb agreement\", \"fix\": \"their benefits outweigh the drawbacks\"}, {\"span\": \"middle fiftys\", \"type\": \"spelling error\", \"fix\": \"middle fifties\"}, {\"span\": \"the fact that most children of geriatric parents become orphans pretty early in their childhood\", \"type\": \"wordiness\", \"fix\": \"most children of geriatric parents become orphans early in childhood\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Use more varied sentence structures to enhance grammatical range.\", \"Pay attention to subject-verb agreement and plural forms.\", \"Avoid wordiness by simplifying phrases for clarity.\"]}], \"overall\": 5.5}"}]}

In this essay, I am going to discuss some relevant reasons for this phenomenon, along with how people could actually research the history of their houses.\r\n\r\nFirst and foremost, questioning the origin of everything has long been somewhat mankind's instinct. Given this, people are into figuring out their houses' history because it does lure them by stimulating the excitement of finding the answer. Indeed, the more ambiguous something is, the more exciting people will be. Second of all, people will feel safe and secure only if they could know the beginning of their living places. This is because, from the idealistic perspective, people might not want to get involved in such horrible events that did happen in their homes. Therefore, they must investigate to get rid of risky outcomes that they might otherwise suffer.\r\n\r\nTo research the history, there are two ways that are easiest for doing the investigation. First, people could ask their previous houses' owners about the past of their homes; hence, knowing a series of stories that are interesting and mind-blowing. Second, senior neighbours are quite relevant and invaluable in telling the old stories because only they witnessed all things that happened in the past. For example, I usually ask my grandparents to know how my house had been looked like before I was born, and the answers always triggered me to ask even more questions.\r\n\r\nIn a nutshell, it is actually exciting and mysterious to dig into the history of something such as residential places. The main cause of this phenomenon stems from the curious attitude that has long been 'programmed' in our brain.

They are not able to get a significant amount of their life experience and develop a wide outlook during a school period. It is happened because the majority subjects in student plan based mostly on theory. It leads to difficulties because candidates are not able to form an advanced experience about their future job. They can achieve it mostly by a practical way. For example, if students crack the books and highlighted only theory, they will not get a full imagination about their future degree. Afterwards, when students are becoming to postgraduates and employees, most of them will have undelighted emotions to their work and field in general.\r\n\r\n\tOn the opposite side, educational institutes can solve the problem. Nowadays, career orientation classes are becoming widespread among numerous universities and schools. It presents possibilities for prospective students: they can try and found themselves in a certain field and gain experience, knowledge and make their world view more sophisticated. For example, the candidate highlighted scientific subjects and thinking about developing in medicine. The school cooperates with the university to organise a medical class, where the student is able to get advanced data, knowledge and taking a part in practical exercises and meetings, which are realised by staff and students from the university. Afterwards, the educational field will become more visible. It can help prospective students to make a considered decision for their future degree at university and job.

For this reason, some people believe that the best way to reduce crime is to educate people in prison so they could get a good job once they are released.\n\nScore this IELTS Task 2 essay according to the rubric, ensuring alignment with the question:\n\nOne of the popular opinions prevailing ubiquitously in the current society is that educating people in prison could reduce the crimes committed. In this essay, I will discuss the merits of the notion and present my opinion.\r\n\r\nFirstly, it is true to a great extent that the citizens who commit crimes are under-educated. Because of this lack of education, people find it difficult to estimate the legal and moral consequences of their actions which oftentimes is a danger to fellow innocent people. Therefore, giving proper education to a person in prison that lead to career opportunities after being released allows them to live a comfortable life without having to resort to unlawful actions. For example, according to a recent article published in the local newspaper; an ex-convict started a small business with the help of the knowledge he possessed during his prison time. Hence, education can definitely turn convicted criminals into model citizens.\r\n\r\nWhile education can be a contributing factor to turning any individual into a responsible person that lives within the confines of the law, it is not the only way.

Towns and cities should consider public places, such as parks and squares, as important as basic infrastructure like housing and transport system.\n\tThe most obvious benefit of public places like parks and squares, is that they serve as the green lungs of a city. It is widely known that trees filter the air by absorbing carbon dioxide and producing oxygen. Trees also help cool down the temperatures of the environment by increasing air humidity and covering the earth surface from direct sunlight. Thus parks with a lot of trees and green spaces can help clean a city's living environment. \n\tGreen and beautiful places like parks and squares also have good impacts on people's spiritual life. If a person leaves in a house without green space or open air, he or she would be more likely to suffer stress or mental diseases because the living environment is to dull. The same situation can occur in cities that only have roads, buildings, and lack green spaces. Parks and squares are the places where people can hang out and relax. This role is increasingly important in the time of rapid urbanization. Parks and squares are also venues for social events and cultural festivals where people have chances to socialize, make friends, explore new things and thus their spiritual life will be enhanced. These events and festivals, together with parks and squares themselves, are also landmarks that reflect cultural characteristics and history of a city or even a nation. Thus, they can become tourist attractions. All over the world, famous public places have become the symbols of a city and a country, such as the Eiffel Tower in Paris, Central Park in New York, the Harbour Bridge in Sydney or the Sword Lake in Hanoi. All these beautiful places are the first things visitors go to when they arrive in those cities.

To what extent do you agree or disagree?\n\nScore this IELTS Task 2 essay according to the rubric, ensuring alignment with the question:\n\nThere are several threats to living in our environment. This has led to some individuals to say that increasing the price of fuel for cars and other vehicles like trucks or buses, is the most effective method to solve many of the environmental problems. I completely agree with this view. The reasons for my opinion will be discussed below.\n\nTo start with, some people do not believe that increasing the charge on the fuel used by motor vehicles is an appropriate way to combat the challenges we face in our surrounding. Their major reason is that this approach will make life unbearable for the poor who perceive it as the cheapest mode of transportation. Similarly, only the rich could afford to buy or use the expensive alternatives for travel. For example, most income earners in developing nations such as Nigeria, commute by car or by bus. So any plan to increase the fuel price will restrcit their travel experience. However, I disagree with this view as it does not consider the damaging effect it has on the environment in the long run.\n\nAdmittedly, there are basic reasons why I believe that a hike in the price of fuel for automobiles will go a long way to solve many of the problems we encounter in our environment. Firstly, it will reduce the number of such vehicles on our road. Consequently, there will be less pollution in the atmosphere as the amount of carbon monoxide, which is the major threat to life, released into the air is greatly minimised. Additionally, commuters will no longer experience traffic congestion. Secondly, it will promote the invention of vehicles that use other energy sources such as electricity or solar energy which are environmentally friendly. For instance, most people in developed countries like China, use electric cars and encourage the use of bicycles for short distance travel. This has helped to reduce climate change in their environment.\n\nIn conclusion, I agree that a rise in the cost of fuel for cars or buses will discourage its use and encourage people to seek better alternatives.

There are several reason to this phenomenon, and people can find a variety of approaches to research these kinds of information.\r\n\r\nThe main reason for searching such information is that people are getting more interested into historical knowledge. Historical knowledge contain a wide variety of living experiences of our human beings such as manufacturing skills. Typically, these experiences involves the condensed wisdom of our ancestors.

With regard to this trend, an array of people propose that schools should integrate voluntary work into the graduation requirements. From my viewpoint,unpaid services are definitely in students’ interest, however, students should be encouraged instead of being compelled. \nTo commence with, it is indubitable that volunteerism  helps students bolster their social skills and widen the scope of their knowledge, which will stand them in good stead when applying for a permanent job. Undertaking a period of unpaid work is a golden chance for students to collaborate with an assortment of people from all social backgrounds, together with whom they can share their experiences and understandings. For example, my aunt, who is a qualified nurse, attributes  her success to the valuable experiences that she gained when working in the local hospital in the role of a candy striper. In her words, without those years of volunteering, her achievements would be far from what she accomplishes today.\nMoreover, it is worth bearing in mind that through volunteer service, students will be better cognizant of the meaningfulness of life and therefore, be more grateful for what they have. As a matter of fact, children nowadays tend to have whatever they want at their fingertips, which renders their demands even more unreasonable. A voluntary trip to the poverty-stricken areas, which give them a chance to meet destitute children, will make them realize that what they take for granted is what other people yearn for.  For instance, one of my cousins, Linh, used to be an exigent child due to the indulging way of upbringing her parents use. However, once time she took part in a voluntary organization aiming at underprivileged children  . After the time there, it dawned on her that she was blessed with nutritional meals and expensive clothes while many other children weren’t and since then, she has appreciated her life more. \nDespite the aforementioned benefits, mandatory services may also be counterproductive in the absence of students’ willingness. Out of disinclination, they may try to shirk their duties or do them unenthusiastically.  Therefore, rather than compel students to join voluntary organizations, schools should induce them by showing the significance of their commitment to the local community. And if possible, students should be spoilt for choice so that they can choose the activities that are congruous with their abilities and hobbies. \nIn conclusion, voluntary work is indeed advantageous to both students themselves and the society.

In this era, more and more people choose to raise the children later in their life. The reasons are many people want to enjoy their early stage of marriage and need more money to raise a child. In this essay, I will explain why the benefit of delaying having a child overshadow the potential drawbacks.\r\n\r\nTo begin with, many people postpone having an offspring because they prefer to enjoy their life in early marriage. The reason is they want to pursue their dreams first. For example, they want to have a specialist degree to become a doctor. Moreover, they do not have enough money to raise a family. People in the early stage of their careers usually do not have more money and it leads them to have a better decision, which is to postpone having a child. \r\n\r\nOn one hand, there is a drawback of having a baby later in life, such as a difficulty in understanding a child. Understanding a youth becomes difficult because the communication do not run well. People will hard to communicate to their children because of a big gap of age there. The people raised a baby when they are too old. As a result, the parents do not understand well what their children want.\r\n\r\nHowever, I would argue that the advantages outweigh the drawbacks. Postponing raising a family brings people happier because they have more time to having quality time together. People can enjoy travelling anywhere without thinking about a baby. Additionally, it gives a wider chance for many people to focus on their early stage of carrier. Nowadays, the environment is highly competitive. People indirectly have to compete with each other to achieve their top career as young as they can. Thus, they postpone raising a family. For instance, in early work stage most consisted of 25 years old-people. If those people work very hard, getting a promotion such as a manager or young executive will be achieved faster. Having said that, it requires more focus and it leads them to postpone having a baby.\r\n\r\nTo conclude, in this era, most people choose to postpone having a offspring because they want to enjoy their life and they have not had enough money to raise a family.

Although some believe that those should be solely made to cater for educational purposes,  others argue that it should be a place of entertainment. In this essay, I provide my views on both but support my claim on the latter.\r\n\r\nOn one hand, the museum's prime focus is to emphasise more on the educational aspect more to make a fine appeal among students. This is important because students across the grades have subjects that resonate with the artefacts present in the museum. Thereby, schools can have mandatory visits that can boost the monetary aspects to improve better. In contrast, when the theme of the place is more non-academical, it will suffer visitors across all age groups or demographics. \r\n\r\nOn the other hand, it's important that how the curator presents their artefacts more in an entertaining and innovative way.

In my point of view, the financial status of a society is greatly affected by atmospheric condition.\r\n\r\nTo begin with, in developing countries weather play a vital role in living style of people. Societies wholly solely depend on environmental situations. It is to say that, people live their lives and celebrate events such as spring festivals to enjoy weather. For example, in Pakistan residential structure, dressing, cuisine and social gatherings reflect intensity of atmosphere which is quite different from residence of European countries. So, the climate not only changes the way of life but also changes dressing and foods of societies.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, weather condition has greatly influence the financial structure of a nation. To be more specific, developing countries rely on agriculture which is directly affected by weather. If environment not dramatically change due to global warming, these nations will easily boost nation economy by growing crops and vegetables. For instance, In Pakistan recently heavy rain had caused a devastating flood; crops and vegetables are destroyed at huge sector. So, flood does not only disturb the agriculture system of country but community is also affected by natural disaster. \r\n\r\nIn my opinion, effects of climate on economy are more likely to high than living style of societies.\r\n\r\nTo conclude, I tend to reiterate although persons’ life style is changed by variation in climate, the effects of economy variations seem to be more significant.

This essay will discuss both sides of the argument before reaching a conclusion. \r\n\r\nOn the one hand, many suggest that there are many other aspects that should be taken care of rather than building new venues and stadiums for games. Governments should take care of ameliorating and improving infrastructures and healthcare services. For instance, many people criticized Brazil for hosting the World Cup events despite the rising rates of poverty and declining medical services; saying that this money should be spent on these areas instead of building brand-new stadiums which be left derelict after the event. As a result, Brazil experienced major financial challenges after the World Cup because they had spent so much money preparing for this event.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, several individuals opine that such international games can have economic benefits in spite of the costs required in organizing them. This because many people flock from different nations to attend these competitions, therefore, revenues can be increased because of tourism.

As a consequence, more visitors decided to visit Egypt, and income from tourism increased.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, although it is argued that money spent on well-known sports competitions should be used for improving existing public services, I strongly believe that they can be a way to maximize a country's income  through attracting more visitors and tourists.\n\nProvide your assessment in the specified JSON format."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"per_criterion\": [{\"name\": \"Task Response\", \"band\": 9.0, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"I agree with the former view.\", \"This essay will discuss both sides of the argument before reaching a conclusion.\", \"I strongly believe that they can be a way to maximize a country's income through attracting more visitors and tourists.\"], \"errors\": [], \"suggestions\": [\"Ensure a more balanced discussion of both sides before stating a strong personal opinion.\", \"Provide more specific examples or data to support claims regarding economic benefits.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Coherence & Cohesion\", \"band\": 8.0, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"This essay will discuss both sides of the argument before reaching a conclusion.\", \"As a result, Brazil experienced major financial challenges after the World Cup because they had spent so much money preparing for this event.\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"This because many people flock from different nations to attend these competitions\", \"type\": \"grammatical error\", \"fix\": \"This is because many people flock from different nations to attend these competitions\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Ensure that all sentences are complete and grammatically correct to enhance clarity.\", \"Use more cohesive devices to link ideas between paragraphs, such as 'Furthermore' or 'In addition' for smoother transitions.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Lexical Resource\", \"band\": 8.0, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"improves the hosting countries reputation\", \"ameliorating and improving infrastructures and healthcare services\", \"maximize a country's income through attracting more visitors and tourists\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"which be left derelict after the event\", \"type\": \"grammatical error\", \"fix\": \"which will be left derelict after the event\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Incorporate a wider range of synonyms to avoid repetition, such as using 'enhance' instead of 'improves'.\", \"Use more complex sentence structures to demonstrate a higher level of lexical sophistication.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Grammatical Range & Accuracy\", \"band\": 9.0, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"this money should be spent on these areas instead of building brand-new stadiums which be left derelict after the event.\", \"several individuals opine that such international games can have economic benefits in spite of the costs required in organizing them.\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"which be left derelict after the event.\", \"type\": \"subject-verb agreement\", \"fix\": \"which will be left derelict after the event.\"}, {\"span\": \"This because many people flock from different nations to attend these competitions, therefore, revenues can be increased because of tourism.\", \"type\": \"sentence fragment\", \"fix\": \"This is because many people flock from different nations to attend these competitions; therefore, revenues can be increased because of tourism.\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Ensure subject-verb agreement is maintained throughout the essay.\", \"Avoid sentence fragments by ensuring that all sentences have a subject and a verb.\"]}], \"overall\": 8.5}"}]}

I am going to scrutinize on both the aspects in further paragraphs before forming any opinion in the last.\n\nTo begin with, on the one side of the coin, there are many reasons for supporting other important subjects in the children’s school curriculum; firstly, modern technology like computer literacy has become the need of the hour.  It is one of the most demanded skills for job in every sector.  If they spend most of their time in learning art they will not be able to face cut-throat competitions of this scenario. Moreover, the knowledge of essential subjects like math, science is highly required in every field. Secondly, Art despite being highly appreciated, still do not ensure any career growth because most of the fields like engineering, marketing, IT professionals and managers are a found graduated and post graduated in these important subjects.\n\nOn the other flip side of the coin, art is a creative skill that has wonderful imagination power. It provides the wings to the fantasy and expresses the feelings without exchange of words. To illustrate, once I have come across with the painting in which the difference between the rich and poor’s plight was depicted through painting only. Moreover, music is also a piece of art and works as a healing therapy into hectic world.  Secondly, artists bring laurels for the country across the world and ensure that the cultural heritage of the country may not extinct.  For this they are highly paid and appreciated.

In this essay, I will discuss both views and provide supporting examples on why economic growth of the world is needed to remove  poverty and hunger from their roots.\r\n\r\nThe supporters of environmental protection believe that saving natural resources is the need of the hour to safeguard future generations. They also think that the globalisation phenomenon, which is evolved to improve the economies of the world nations by allowing the business relationships between countries is leading to different types of pollution. The aviation industry, for instance, is itself generating 27% of the total pollution due to  fossil-fuel combustion, which is not fully true as per my opinion though. Thus, many people think it is major harm to future generations if a proper solution is not derived. \r\n\r\nOn the other hand, people who believe economic growth is essential, including me, strongly recommend for the same as many communities are dying without food. It is needless to say that developed countries should come forward to establish companies in under-developed nations to encourage their financial growth and employment opportunities. The USA's latest move towards  investment in finding the oil and gas resources in Brazil, for example, is appreciated by all the world nations. These kinds of decisions by rich countries eventually improve the financial stability of poor regions to eradicate  poverty and hunger.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, some people believe that economic growth is the reason for nature's destruction, while others think that without food and economic enhancements public will strive to death.

Others say individuals should save during their working years to fund their own retirement. What is your opinion?\n\nScore this IELTS Task 2 essay according to the rubric, ensuring alignment with the question:\n\nElderly people are important for every nation, although some think that government intervention is needed to assist their funds during retirement, while some individuals believe the elderly should have saved their income to take care of themselves. I believe older people should save their income during their employment, and government support is also needed for them. \n\nOn the one hand, authorities should take responsibility for older people as they contributed to their workforce when they were young. For example, welfare services such as distributing food coupons or discount vouchers to buy from grocery stores. In addition, private and public sectors should work together to earn additional sources of income. For example, these sectors should provide incentives to invest elderly savings into businesses. By doing so, the elderly will have support when they retire as they receive income from these organisations. Furthermore, authorities should assist older peoplehealth-related problems, therefore, such costs may not be a burden to old people. Therefore, it can be seen that these supports will create a comfortable life for elderly people. \n\nOn the other hand, people should prepare for their retirement before they reach their retirement age. One of the preparations is to invest their savings into potential financial benefit sources such as investing in stocks. Additionally, individuals should also look into property markets. For example, they buy a property while they have enough spending and they can later rent to get an additional income. Moreover, the elderly should find ways to invest their savings into hedge funds where they could make a profit. Hence, there are many benefits when they know how to allocate their savings.\n\nTo sum up, I think it is now obvious that old people should take charge of their funds with the help of governments, private and public sectors.

There are two schools of thought, one believes that competing in games is favorable for child learning, while others think that there are negative consequences. I believe that sports competition encourages the child to be strong, and courageous, however, there are some adverse effects.\nCompetitive sports, such as football, baseball, cricket e.t.c. train a child to analyze, plan and execute. They bring out the best in a person. Children tend to perform better and at a higher rate if they are made to compete with one another.

Secondly, plenty of old parents have diseases, that is mean their sons will do all the work of the house, also the daughters will do all their mother's work. In addition, the oldest daughter will need to care for her youngest siblings. Another point  is that old society usually dies especially if they have diseases.

However, some people say that it is impossible to be a “responsible tourist”. To what extent do you agree or disagree?\n\nScore this IELTS Task 2 essay according to the rubric, ensuring alignment with the question:\n\nIt is argued that it is not possible for people who travel, to maintain their culture and care for the environment when visiting other places. This essay disagrees with this statement because individuals are taught to protect the world and investigations are done first.\r\n\r\nThe main reason for this is that there is an increasing concern about protecting the planet. So people in their own country, at schools, looking at the news and in other ways are taught about how important is to protect the place where they live. So they have in their mind what they should do and what not, and destroying the environment is one thing that they cannot do. Recent research concluded that in Germany although there are a large number of tourists every month  there is almost no trash on the floors, and there is not  increase in contamination and global warming even with the huge amount of visitors. \r\n\r\nAnother reason is that when people decide to travel to other countries will look for information about that place. Normally the internet has lots of  information about the culture of the nation and if there is something that individuals should really consider, it can be easily found on the internet. Also, when people decide to visit somewhere  because they like those places, then they are willing to follow those cultures if needed. For example, there are more and more people travelling to Asia, but their culture is very different from European one, nevertheless, most  European people are disposed to not do what is not allowed and follow their culture.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, travellers normally will carry out research in advance and they know from their own city and town that individuals should not harm the planet,  I, therefore, believe that it is possible to be a responsible tourist.\n\nProvide your assessment in the specified JSON format."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"per_criterion\": [{\"name\": \"Task Response\", \"band\": 6.0, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"individuals are taught to protect the world and investigations are done first\", \"travellers normally will carry out research in advance and they know from their own city and town that individuals should not harm the planet\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"there is not increase in contamination and global warming\", \"type\": \"clarity\", \"fix\": \"there is no increase in contamination and global warming\"}, {\"span\": \"the culture of the nation and if there is something that individuals should really consider, it can be easily found on the internet\", \"type\": \"coherence\", \"fix\": \"the culture of the nation, and any important considerations can be easily found on the internet\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Provide more specific examples or data to support claims about responsible tourism.\", \"Clarify the connections between ideas to improve coherence and flow.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Coherence & Cohesion\", \"band\": 5.0, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"individuals are taught to protect the world and investigations are done first\", \"there is an increasing concern about protecting the planet\", \"travellers normally will carry out research in advance\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"how important is to protect the place where they live\", \"type\": \"grammatical error\", \"fix\": \"how important it is to protect the place where they live\"}, {\"span\": \"when people decide to travel to other countries will look for information about that place\", \"type\": \"sentence structure error\", \"fix\": \"when people decide to travel to other countries, they will look for information about that place\"}, {\"span\": \"most European people are disposed to not do what is not allowed\", \"type\": \"clarity error\", \"fix\": \"most European people are inclined to follow the rules and customs\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Ensure that sentence structures are complete and clear to improve readability.\", \"Use more varied linking words and phrases to enhance the flow between ideas.\", \"Clarify ambiguous phrases to ensure the reader understands the intended meaning.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Lexical Resource\", \"band\": 5.0, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"there is an increasing concern about protecting the planet\", \"they are willing to follow those cultures if needed\", \"I, therefore, believe that it is possible to be a responsible tourist\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"how important is to protect the place\", \"type\": \"word order\", \"fix\": \"how important it is to protect the place\"}, {\"span\": \"there is not increase in contamination\", \"type\": \"grammar\", \"fix\": \"there is no increase in contamination\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Use a wider range of vocabulary to express ideas more precisely and avoid repetition.\", \"Pay attention to grammatical structures, especially in complex sentences, to enhance clarity.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Grammatical Range & Accuracy\", \"band\": 6.0, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"individuals are taught to protect the world\", \"there is an increasing concern about protecting the planet\", \"travellers normally will carry out research in advance\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"how important is to protect the place\", \"type\": \"word order\", \"fix\": \"how important it is to protect the place\"}, {\"span\": \"there is not increase in contamination\", \"type\": \"article usage\", \"fix\": \"there is no increase in contamination\"}, {\"span\": \"most European people are disposed to not do what is not allowed\", \"type\": \"double negative\", \"fix\": \"most European people are disposed to do what is allowed\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Ensure correct word order in indirect questions, such as 'how important it is to protect the place'.\", \"Use appropriate articles to enhance clarity, e.g., 'there is no increase in contamination'.\", \"Avoid double negatives to improve clarity, e.g., rephrase to 'most European people are disposed to do what is allowed'.\"]}], \"overall\": 5.5}"}]}

What peoblem do you think youth unemployment will cause to the individual and society? Give reasons and make suggestion.\n\nScore this IELTS Task 2 essay according to the rubric, ensuring alignment with the question:\n\nYouth unemployment is an ongoing issue that's continually growing. As more young people are opting out of school and lack the qualifications for a career after graduation, this is posing a greater threat to society and towards the individuals. The significant shortcomings for both individuals and society will be outlined in this essay. \r\n\r\nPerceivably, the biggest shortcomings of youth unemployment towards individuals are the financial burden. It's evidently clear that dropping out of school leads to a lack of education qualification which plays a vital role in applying for professional careers. Therefore, by having no active income, these individuals have no choice but to depend on their family and friends for financial assistance. Moreover, such actions could potentially persuade younger individuals to turn towards the life of criminals. Thus, government interventions will be necessary by providing free educational courses and offering a wide variety of career options available for students with low or no educational qualifications. \r\n\r\nIn addition, youth unemployment can only bring tremendous amounts of issues to society. Without younger professionals entering the workforce, the shortage of skilled professionals causes economic downfall, lower revenues and morale issues. As the number of new recruits entering the workforce decreases, the workload for existing employees will gradually increase, leading to morale issues between employees. Moreover, such a phenomenon will also lead to lower revenues generated by businesses which eventually results in economic downfall. Thus, hiring standards by organisations should be lowered to consider applicants with lower educational qualifications. \r\n\r\nTo conclude, the shortcomings of youth unemployment for both young people and society are tremendous. Such a phenomenon can be resolved by government intervention and effort from organisations to lower hiring standards to give every applicant a chance despite their educational background.\n\nProvide your assessment in the specified JSON format."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"per_criterion\": [{\"name\": \"Task Response\", \"band\": 6.5, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"the significant shortcomings for both individuals and society will be outlined in this essay.\", \"the biggest shortcomings of youth unemployment towards individuals are the financial burden.\", \"the shortcomings of youth unemployment for both young people and society are tremendous.\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"the shortage of skilled professionals causes economic downfall, lower revenues and morale issues.\", \"type\": \"lack of clarity\", \"fix\": \"clarify how these issues are interconnected and provide specific examples.\"}, {\"span\": \"Thus, hiring standards by organisations should be lowered to consider applicants with lower educational qualifications.\", \"type\": \"overgeneralization\", \"fix\": \"provide a more nuanced argument about the potential consequences of lowering hiring standards.\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Include specific examples or statistics to support claims about the impact of youth unemployment.\", \"Expand on the proposed solutions to provide a more detailed plan for addressing youth unemployment.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Coherence & Cohesion\", \"band\": 5.5, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"the significant shortcomings for both individuals and society will be outlined in this essay.\", \"the biggest shortcomings of youth unemployment towards individuals are the financial burden.\", \"the shortcomings of youth unemployment for both young people and society are tremendous.\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"the shortage of skilled professionals causes economic downfall, lower revenues and morale issues.\", \"type\": \"lack of parallel structure\", \"fix\": \"ensure parallel structure by changing to 'the shortage of skilled professionals causes economic downfall, lowers revenues, and creates morale issues.'\"}, {\"span\": \"the workload for existing employees will gradually increase, leading to morale issues between employees.\", \"type\": \"repetition\", \"fix\": \"replace 'morale issues between employees' with 'decreased morale among employees' to avoid repetition.\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Use clearer topic sentences to enhance the logical flow between paragraphs.\", \"Ensure that all lists maintain parallel structure for better readability.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Lexical Resource\", \"band\": 5.5, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"the biggest shortcomings of youth unemployment towards individuals are the financial burden\", \"the shortage of skilled professionals causes economic downfall, lower revenues and morale issues\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"the financial burden\", \"type\": \"word choice\", \"fix\": \"the financial burden on individuals\"}, {\"span\": \"the shortage of skilled professionals causes economic downfall\", \"type\": \"collocation\", \"fix\": \"the shortage of skilled professionals leads to economic decline\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Use a wider range of vocabulary to express ideas more precisely and avoid repetition.\", \"Improve collocation usage to enhance the naturalness of the language.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Grammatical Range & Accuracy\", \"band\": 6.5, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"the biggest shortcomings of youth unemployment towards individuals are the financial burden.\", \"the workload for existing employees will gradually increase, leading to morale issues between employees.\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"the significant shortcomings for both individuals and society will be outlined in this essay.\", \"type\": \"subject-verb agreement\", \"fix\": \"the significant shortcomings of both individuals and society will be outlined in this essay.\"}, {\"span\": \"the shortage of skilled professionals causes economic downfall, lower revenues and morale issues.\", \"type\": \"parallel structure\", \"fix\": \"the shortage of skilled professionals causes economic downfall, lowers revenues, and creates morale issues.\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Ensure subject-verb agreement is maintained throughout the essay.\", \"Use parallel structure when listing multiple items to enhance clarity and flow.\"]}], \"overall\": 6.0}"}]}

Similar goods and products are available all over the world via e-commerce websites and offline markets. In this essay, we will discuss both positive and negative aspects of it.\r\n\r\nTo begin with, international trade has increased exponentially in the last 2 decades due to technological advancement and brand establishments. Big brands like Zara, Gucci and Prada have their presence across the globe. Their stores can be found in almost all the countries. Just like this brand's, there are many other brand's which are available across the globe. Due to globalisation, it has become convenient for buyers to buy products of international brands in their own country. Initially, only people who could afford to travel to different countries were able to buy international products. However, now the scenario has changed and many of this brand's shops are available in almost all the countries where people can buy them offline or they can order them online.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, there are a few negative aspects of having similar shops and products in different countries. First, there is no diversity in designs. Similar designs can be found in different countries. Second, countries lack the authenticity of their local products as they are available or listed on platforms like amazon which allows sellers to sell products internationally. For example, recently one of my colleagues had visited Paris for her vacation. she wanted to do some shopping in Paris however, she could not find any unique design which she can buy as a souvenir. Those same shops and designs were also available in her home country with a minimal variation in price.\r\n\r\nTo sum up, there are many benefits which surpass the negative aspects of having similar shops across the globe as this give a homelike feeling to someone who is planning to stay in a different country for months or years.\n\nProvide your assessment in the specified JSON format."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"per_criterion\": [{\"name\": \"Task Response\", \"band\": 8.0, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"we will discuss both positive and negative aspects of it\", \"there are many benefits which surpass the negative aspects of having similar shops across the globe\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"Just like this brand's, there are many other brand's which are available across the globe\", \"type\": \"grammatical error\", \"fix\": \"Just like these brands, there are many other brands that are available across the globe.\"}, {\"span\": \"she wanted to do some shopping in Paris however, she could not find any unique design which she can buy as a souvenir\", \"type\": \"punctuation error\", \"fix\": \"she wanted to do some shopping in Paris; however, she could not find any unique design that she could buy as a souvenir.\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Provide more specific examples to support the points made about the negative aspects of globalization.\", \"Clarify the conclusion by summarizing the main points discussed in the essay.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Coherence & Cohesion\", \"band\": 7.0, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"To begin with, international trade has increased exponentially in the last 2 decades due to technological advancement and brand establishments.\", \"On the other hand, there are a few negative aspects of having similar shops and products in different countries.\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"Just like this brand's, there are many other brand's which are available across the globe.\", \"type\": \"punctuation and possessive errors\", \"fix\": \"Correct 'this brand's' to 'these brands' and 'brand's' to 'brands'\"}, {\"span\": \"however, she could not find any unique design which she can buy as a souvenir.\", \"type\": \"capitalization error\", \"fix\": \"Capitalize 'however' to 'However'\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Ensure consistency in the use of possessive forms and pluralization to avoid confusion.\", \"Use transitional phrases more effectively to enhance the flow between contrasting ideas.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Lexical Resource\", \"band\": 7.0, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"international trade has increased exponentially in the last 2 decades\", \"Due to globalisation, it has become convenient for buyers to buy products of international brands in their own country.\", \"there is no diversity in designs.\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"this brand's\", \"type\": \"possessive error\", \"fix\": \"this brand\"}, {\"span\": \"brand's which are available\", \"type\": \"possessive error\", \"fix\": \"brands that are available\"}, {\"span\": \"this give a homelike feeling\", \"type\": \"subject-verb agreement error\", \"fix\": \"this gives a homelike feeling\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Avoid using possessive forms incorrectly; use plural forms or relative clauses instead.\", \"Ensure subject-verb agreement is maintained throughout the essay.\", \"Vary vocabulary to avoid repetition, especially with common terms like 'brands' and 'products'.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Grammatical Range & Accuracy\", \"band\": 8.0, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"international trade has increased exponentially in the last 2 decades due to technological advancement and brand establishments.\", \"Due to globalisation, it has become convenient for buyers to buy products of international brands in their own country.\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"Just like this brand's, there are many other brand's which are available across the globe.\", \"type\": \"apostrophe misuse\", \"fix\": \"Just like this brand, there are many other brands which are available across the globe.\"}, {\"span\": \"she wanted to do some shopping in Paris however, she could not find any unique design which she can buy as a souvenir.\", \"type\": \"capitalization and punctuation error\", \"fix\": \"She wanted to do some shopping in Paris; however, she could not find any unique design which she could buy as a souvenir.\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Ensure correct use of apostrophes, especially when pluralizing nouns.\", \"Use appropriate punctuation to separate independent clauses for better clarity.\"]}], \"overall\": 7.5}"}]}

Some individuals believe that the price of fuel should be increased to tackle this problem. Although I agree with this opinion, I think that the increasing rate of fuel cost would also have negative effects on society.\r\n\r\nOn the one hand, raising the price of fuel will be far beneficial. According to this, many people would avoid driving their own cars since they will not be able to afford the high cost of fuel. Besides, they will be motivated to take more public transportation instead of their private cars, resulting in decreasing the heavy traffics. Therefore, the lower consumption of fuel will improve the quality of air, reducing many health problems. For instance, many people have died annually as a result of lung cancer and respiratory diseases that are caused by air pollution.\r\n\r\non the other hand, increasing the fuel cost would have many drawbacks. Firstly, the public transportation cost will be escalated due to the expensive fuel. Secondly, the transportation expenses for businesses would also be raised. In such cases, companies will be forced to increase the prices of their products to compensate for these high expenses. Thus, people would be burdened with higher living costs. If the government can control these increasing rates of transportation and goods, the solution of high fuel prices would be more advantaged.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, while increasing the fuel cost could place many people under the pressure of difficult economic situations, I agree that it is vital for solving environmental problems.\n\nProvide your assessment in the specified JSON format."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"per_criterion\": [{\"name\": \"Task Response\", \"band\": 7.0, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"the upward trend of fuel consumption is one of the main reasons for environmental degradation\", \"I agree with this opinion, I think that the increasing rate of fuel cost would also have negative effects on society\", \"increasing the fuel cost could place many people under the pressure of difficult economic situations\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"the lower consumption of fuel will improve the quality of air\", \"type\": \"clarity\", \"fix\": \"rephrase to clarify that lower fuel consumption leads to improved air quality\"}, {\"span\": \"the solution of high fuel prices would be more advantaged\", \"type\": \"clarity\", \"fix\": \"rephrase to say 'the solution to high fuel prices would be more advantageous'\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Provide more specific examples or data to support the argument about the benefits of raising fuel prices.\", \"Clarify the negative effects of increased fuel prices on society with more detailed explanations.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Coherence & Cohesion\", \"band\": 6.0, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"the upward trend of fuel consumption is one of the main reasons for environmental degradation\", \"the lower consumption of fuel will improve the quality of air, reducing many health problems\", \"the solution of high fuel prices would be more advantaged\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"the lower consumption of fuel will improve the quality of air, reducing many health problems\", \"type\": \"logical connection\", \"fix\": \"Clarify how reducing fuel consumption directly leads to improved air quality and health benefits.\"}, {\"span\": \"the solution of high fuel prices would be more advantaged\", \"type\": \"clarity\", \"fix\": \"Rephrase to 'the solution of high fuel prices would have more advantages' for clearer meaning.\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Use clearer transitions between ideas to enhance the flow of the essay.\", \"Ensure that each paragraph clearly relates back to the main argument to strengthen coherence.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Lexical Resource\", \"band\": 6.0, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"the upward trend of fuel consumption is one of the main reasons for environmental degradation\", \"raising the price of fuel will be far beneficial\", \"the solution of high fuel prices would be more advantaged\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"decreasing the heavy traffics\", \"type\": \"word choice\", \"fix\": \"decreasing heavy traffic\"}, {\"span\": \"the public transportation cost will be escalated\", \"type\": \"word choice\", \"fix\": \"the cost of public transportation will increase\"}, {\"span\": \"the solution of high fuel prices would be more advantaged\", \"type\": \"grammatical error\", \"fix\": \"the solution to high fuel prices would be more advantageous\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Use more precise vocabulary to enhance clarity and accuracy.\", \"Avoid redundancy in phrases to improve conciseness.\", \"Practice using more varied sentence structures to demonstrate a wider range of lexical resource.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Grammatical Range & Accuracy\", \"band\": 7.0, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"the upward trend of fuel consumption is one of the main reasons for environmental degradation\", \"raising the price of fuel will be far beneficial\", \"the solution of high fuel prices would be more advantaged\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"decreasing the heavy traffics\", \"type\": \"subject-verb agreement\", \"fix\": \"decreasing the heavy traffic\"}, {\"span\": \"the solution of high fuel prices would be more advantaged\", \"type\": \"word choice\", \"fix\": \"the solution to high fuel prices would be more advantageous\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Ensure subject-verb agreement, especially with uncountable nouns like 'traffic'.\", \"Use more precise vocabulary to enhance clarity, such as replacing 'advantaged' with 'advantageous'.\"]}], \"overall\": 6.5}"}]}

Providing moral and social education could help criminals to understand in depth the value of behaving properly.

Nevertheless, some people argue a more effective way would be education. In terms of the committed crime, I totally agree that imprisonment would be the best way as a conviction, which is beneficial for self-reflection and social impact. \r\n\r\nProviding a plethora of prisons seems the most favourite preference for some countries in order to undermine devious criminals. This selection may be opted to protect communities from the offenders since they do not recognize if there is a villain in surrounding that will emerge the next crime possibility. Moreover, it looks helpful for the offender to do self-evaluation and behave in positive manners when they are settled inside, so they may realize their mistakes . To illustrate, in Indonesia, the persuasive methods is not efficient enough to decrease the number of criminals, so entering the offenders to jails is the main conviction if they are being accused. They will be arrested and investigated with the police officers and processed into prisons. Consequently, the criminal rate plummets significantly, and the societies feel safe and convenient to do activities outside. \r\n\r\nOn the other hand, applying education methods, such as mediation or rehabilitation does not support making the offenders feel guilty and give up doing the crime, even though some people still believe that this approach would be effective. Nonetheless, there is real evidence that it is not useful to combat the crime, Canada as an example. This country has the jeopardy gangster that will savage murder and cannot bargain with anyone, including the government officers. Thus, it is mandatory to do a harsh procedure to raid them and put them into jail.\r\n\r\nIn summary, I considered preferring imprisonment as the best way since it has several benefits of the aforementioned rather than using the persuasive method like education.\n\nProvide your assessment in the specified JSON format."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"per_criterion\": [{\"name\": \"Task Response\", \"band\": 8.5, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"I totally agree that imprisonment would be the best way as a conviction, which is beneficial for self-reflection and social impact.\", \"Consequently, the criminal rate plummets significantly, and the societies feel safe and convenient to do activities outside.\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"the persuasive methods is not efficient enough\", \"type\": \"subject-verb agreement\", \"fix\": \"the persuasive methods are not efficient enough\"}, {\"span\": \"the jeopardy gangster that will savage murder\", \"type\": \"word choice/clarity\", \"fix\": \"the dangerous gangsters who commit savage murders\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Clarify the argument by providing more specific examples of how imprisonment leads to self-reflection.\", \"Strengthen the counterargument by elaborating on the potential benefits of education methods in reducing crime.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Coherence & Cohesion\", \"band\": 7.5, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"the persuasive methods is not efficient enough to decrease the number of criminals\", \"the criminal rate plummets significantly, and the societies feel safe and convenient to do activities outside\", \"I considered preferring imprisonment as the best way since it has several benefits of the aforementioned rather than using the persuasive method like education\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"the persuasive methods is not efficient enough\", \"type\": \"subject-verb agreement\", \"fix\": \"the persuasive methods are not efficient enough\"}, {\"span\": \"the societies feel safe and convenient to do activities outside\", \"type\": \"word choice\", \"fix\": \"the societies feel safe and comfortable to engage in activities outside\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Ensure subject-verb agreement is maintained throughout the essay.\", \"Use more precise vocabulary to enhance clarity and avoid ambiguity.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Lexical Resource\", \"band\": 7.5, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"providing a plethora of prisons seems the most favourite preference\", \"the persuasive methods is not efficient enough to decrease the number of criminals\", \"it is mandatory to do a harsh procedure to raid them\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"the persuasive methods is not efficient enough\", \"type\": \"subject-verb agreement\", \"fix\": \"the persuasive methods are not efficient enough\"}, {\"span\": \"the societies feel safe and convenient\", \"type\": \"word choice\", \"fix\": \"the societies feel safe and comfortable\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Use a wider range of synonyms to avoid repetition, such as replacing 'crime' with 'offense' or 'criminal activity'.\", \"Ensure subject-verb agreement is maintained throughout the essay to enhance grammatical accuracy.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Grammatical Range & Accuracy\", \"band\": 8.5, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"Providing a plethora of prisons seems the most favourite preference for some countries in order to undermine devious criminals.\", \"Moreover, it looks helpful for the offender to do self-evaluation and behave in positive manners when they are settled inside.\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"the persuasive methods is not efficient enough\", \"type\": \"subject-verb agreement\", \"fix\": \"the persuasive methods are not efficient enough\"}, {\"span\": \"the societies feel safe and convenient to do activities outside.\", \"type\": \"word choice\", \"fix\": \"the societies feel safe and comfortable to engage in activities outside.\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Vary sentence structures further by incorporating more complex sentences to enhance the overall grammatical range.\", \"Ensure subject-verb agreement is maintained throughout the essay to improve accuracy.\"]}], \"overall\": 8.0}"}]}

From my perspective, I am totally against this viewpoint and will elaborate on some reasons to justify this stance.\r\n\r\nFirst and foremost, the primary rationale would appear to be better growth. That is to say, when children possess more opportunities to access  education, they can develop all aspects of their mental and physical health. It means that they can study some subjects, typically math, gymnastics, and science. Therefore, they can boost their brains to acquire new information and have sufficient knowledge for working in the future and enhance their major competence with top-notch initiatives.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, another motive relates to higher soft skills. To be more specific, they not only broaden their horizons but also receive a variety of meaningful lessons and experiences pertaining to strange situations. Moreover, if they are taught for a longer time, they will meet some practical behaviours and then know how to apply their expertise to solve difficult circumstances. As a result, they know the ways to go through ups and downs as well as obstacles. For example, they are educated in good communication abilities to team up with their peers in order to obtain the best results in their work. From that, young generations effortlessly implement these things for their career later and reach their summit of professions. \r\n\r\nIn conclusion, it would be logical to conclude that giving up going to high school should be rejected by virtue of better growth and higher soft skills.

The prevalence of technology has driven people to be less active than before. Individuals spend most of their time sitting on the couch using their mobile phones or their laptops.

Therefore, they should find new ways to burn calories, such as exercising or walking to work.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, most people cram a huge amount of tasks in one day, so they do not have time to cook and eat healthy food at home. In such circumstances, an increase in the price of fast food is not the best possible way because many people can afford it.  The better way is that cafes and restaurants offer a vast variety of healthy foods, like, different salads or sea foods. It would encourage people to choose them.

In recent times, some individuals decide to give birth at a later age. Although there are some benefits attached to that, such as, mental and emotional maturity, as well as financial stability, there are also risks of having a baby with deformity, not being able to give children optimum parenting due to lack physical fitness, unavailability, which I believe outweigh the benefits. \r\n\r\nTo begin, so many people in this modern society would rather prefer to pursue their career first, get a job and have a steady income before venturing into marriage and childbearing. Their reason is that it makes it very easy to train the children without having to face the challenges of finance, as such children mostly lack nothing. For instance, when one is financially buoyant, they can afford to train their children to any level of education. More so, some people also think that it’s better to be mentally mature enough to be able to face emotional ups and downs that come with childbearing and parenting. \r\n\r\nOn the other hand, as some people are busy pursuing their careers, they tend to forget that age is not on their side, hence old age increases one’s chances of giving birth to abnormal babies. Furthermore, when parents are busy  and so engulfed with their job, they have little or no time to monitor their youngsters and attend to their needs. In addition, early retirement age might catch up with one, thereby affecting their income, and besides, old age comes with weakness and poses the risk of lack energy required to control children. For instance, an elderly man who has  a two year old toddler would find it tasking to walk the baby around the house.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, in as much as there are advantages to early child bearing and upbringing such as a steady income, mental and emotional maturity, the disadvantages which includes, lack of availability due to busy schedules, having babies with congenital anomalies exceed the advantages.\n\nProvide your assessment in the specified JSON format."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"per_criterion\": [{\"name\": \"Task Response\", \"band\": 5.5, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"there are also risks of having a baby with deformity, not being able to give children optimum parenting due to lack physical fitness, unavailability, which I believe outweigh the benefits.\", \"the disadvantages which includes, lack of availability due to busy schedules, having babies with congenital anomalies exceed the advantages.\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"lack physical fitness, unavailability\", \"type\": \"clarity\", \"fix\": \"rephrase to 'lack of physical fitness and availability'\"}, {\"span\": \"the disadvantages which includes\", \"type\": \"grammar\", \"fix\": \"correct to 'the disadvantages which include'\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Provide clearer topic sentences for each paragraph to enhance the overall structure and clarity of the argument.\", \"Expand on the examples provided to better illustrate the points made, particularly regarding the risks of late childbearing.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Coherence & Cohesion\", \"band\": 4.5, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"there are also risks of having a baby with deformity, not being able to give children optimum parenting due to lack physical fitness, unavailability, which I believe outweigh the benefits.\", \"their reason is that it makes it very easy to train the children without having to face the challenges of finance, as such children mostly lack nothing.\", \"the disadvantages which includes, lack of availability due to busy schedules, having babies with congenital anomalies exceed the advantages.\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"lack physical fitness, unavailability, which I believe outweigh the benefits.\", \"type\": \"sentence structure\", \"fix\": \"Revise to clarify the relationship between ideas, e.g., 'the risks of having a baby with deformities and the inability to provide optimum parenting due to lack of physical fitness and unavailability outweigh the benefits.'\"}, {\"span\": \"the disadvantages which includes, lack of availability due to busy schedules, having babies with congenital anomalies exceed the advantages.\", \"type\": \"subject-verb agreement\", \"fix\": \"Change 'includes' to 'include' to match the plural subject 'disadvantages'.\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Use clearer transitions between ideas to enhance the flow of the essay.\", \"Ensure subject-verb agreement is maintained throughout the essay.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Lexical Resource\", \"band\": 4.5, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"mental and emotional maturity\", \"financial stability\", \"lack physical fitness\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"lack physical fitness\", \"type\": \"word choice\", \"fix\": \"lack of physical fitness\"}, {\"span\": \"having babies with congenital anomalies exceed the advantages\", \"type\": \"subject-verb agreement\", \"fix\": \"having babies with congenital anomalies exceeds the advantages\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Use a wider range of vocabulary to express ideas more clearly and accurately.\", \"Pay attention to grammatical structures, especially subject-verb agreement and prepositions.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Grammatical Range & Accuracy\", \"band\": 5.5, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"there are also risks of having a baby with deformity\", \"it makes it very easy to train the children without having to face the challenges of finance\", \"the disadvantages which includes, lack of availability due to busy schedules\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"lack physical fitness\", \"type\": \"missing preposition\", \"fix\": \"lack of physical fitness\"}, {\"span\": \"the disadvantages which includes\", \"type\": \"subject-verb agreement\", \"fix\": \"the disadvantages which include\"}, {\"span\": \"lack energy required to control children\", \"type\": \"missing article\", \"fix\": \"lack of energy required to control children\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Ensure to use appropriate prepositions where necessary to improve clarity.\", \"Pay attention to subject-verb agreement, especially with plural subjects.\", \"Incorporate articles where needed to enhance grammatical accuracy.\"]}], \"overall\": 5.0}"}]}

In this essay, I will discuss both views and explain why I agree that adolescents should not be encouraged to evaluate their teachers.\r\n\r\nThose who support the concept of evaluation done by students feel that this may improve educational quality. In many cases, the level of comprehension of students relies not on the content of the lesson but on the way teachers conduct it. If, for example, the class is slow, it will be ineffective for teachers to teach too fast so that most students fail to retain the information. Indeed, if learners did not give comments, it would have become arduous to know whether the speed of the lesson is appropriate for the class or not. Ultimately, this feedback will improve the quality of studies and teaching methods.\r\n\r\nDespite these arguments, others, myself included, feel that such criticism and feedback will adversely affect the atmosphere in the classroom. Certainly, teachers can be vulnerable to the negative words of students, and the classroom may be in chaos due to the massive number of comments. As a result, the student-teacher relationship would get disturbed, and their emotional bonding will become weak. Furthermore, such an atmosphere would be impractical for teachers to work out a teaching method that can satisfy all students, and they will pay less attention and care in the classroom.

Therefore, they can acquire the benefits of teamwork and can develop communication skills. Another way is taking group examinationsgroup examinations.

Do  you agree or disagree with statement?\n\nScore this IELTS Task 2 essay according to the rubric, ensuring alignment with the question:\n\nIn this contemporary era, there was some discussion about the existence and necessity of parks  and squares in cities. While some people feel that these open spaces are necessary, others insist  that these spaces make the land useless and therefore need to be used for practical purposes. In  my opinion, parks and squares are of great value to both the city and its residents, despite the  voices against large public spaces. To commence with, open spaces have always been considered the heart of cities, where people  gather for meetings and leisure activities. In addition, children and their parents spend a lot of time  in these places after a busy daily routine. The growing pollution in cities is of great concern to the  government and townspeople, and places such as parks and squares often provide recreation for  the elderly. Moreover, such places attract tourists because, as a rule, their creation is associated  with history. For example, all European cities are famous for their beautiful gardens and squares in  the city center. Thus, it is absolutely imperative to preserve them for future generations. However, it cannot be denied that the cities become crowded every day and there are not enough  places for the construction of public and commercial centers. New transportation systems are  coming to cities and need more space to build stations and wider lanes. For example, the  construction of London was planned almost two hundred years ago, and the roads in the city were  small and narrow, and they were designed for carts, not cars and buses. Later, London City  authorities turned many of the historic parks and gardens into car parks and highways. This  transformation has been publicly criticized by civilians and other city planners. Thus, destroying  parks and other public spaces for ongoing benefits is not a solution to urban space scarcity. To sum up, our future generations need large public areas. Cities are facing significant pressure to  build solid infrastructure for growing populations, but this cannot be allowed at the expense of  parks and squares.

They believe this would benefit both the individual teenager and society as a whole. Do you agree or disagree?\n\nScore this IELTS Task 2 essay according to the rubric, ensuring alignment with the question:\n\nMany teenagers take part in volunteer work nowadays, whether it be out of kindness or to have something for their resumé. However, the concept of imposing unpaid work on them to benefit the local community raises issues regarding ethics and perhaps even the law. Therefore, I wholeheartedly disagree with it.\r\n\r\nIt is integral that we consider this issue in a more ethical manner. Teenagers, as they stand, are already making a considerable impact on our society through academics alone. It would simply be outrageous to add onto their responsibilities and require them to balance both work and school, let alone unpaid work. As teenagers, they have the right to experience everything their youth has to offer— spending time with friends, finding hobbies, doing fun activities, and so on. Studying already takes up enough of their time.\r\n\r\nBut of course, there are legal factors that come into play as well. Teenagers are, by definition, people aged between 13-19 years. Thus, most teenagers would be considered minors. In turn, under the eyes of the law, that may make forcing teenagers to work equivalent to child labor in most cases. \r\n\r\nTo conclude, I absolutely disagree with requiring teenagers to do unpaid work to benefit the local community.

To what extent do you agree or disagree?\n\nScore this IELTS Task 2 essay according to the rubric, ensuring alignment with the question:\n\nIn this day and age, contemporary attention has been placed on whether leaders with more years of age or younger directors are better for the management positions in corporations. I strongly believe that senior managers possess more advantages than their counterparts in leading an organization due to some reasons below.\r\n\r\nTo begin with, it is not an exaggeration to say that seniors committed most of their life to the workplace. During the company development, they have faced multiple challenges, dealt with unexpected situations and witnessed various ups and downs. This means they possess a wide range of specialized knowledge and practical experiences to come up with solutions for any circumstances, which is not an advantage of younger leaders. Besides, choosing to work in the same place even at old age means that they are loyal to the place and would love to be a permanent part of the system. With that being said, managers with more years of age can lead a corporation more effectively, compared to the younger ones.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, when it comes to the success of a company, it is the employees’ level of trust and respect in their manager that matters. Generally, senior leaders are less likely to encounter any difficulties gaining respect from other colleagues. To be more particular, they can maintain the stability and solidarity of a group since those years working alongside the staff provided them with  a profound understanding of each member and a powerful voice in the workplace. Meanwhile, young individuals need to prove themselves worthy for the position and make efforts to gain trust from their employees.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, it is undeniable that some people may believe authority positions should be held by young leaders.

Apart from experiencing the art visually, we are likely to be entertained in different ways.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, some people argue that museums should concentrate on education. I would agree that teenagers would be beneficial from visiting museums. Museums is the most popular place for school trips.

As an example, one of my friends is 35 years old and married and she is rejecting to have children at that age because she wants to enjoy life and she hasn’t achieved her targets. Thus, having children at the latter age is risky for women because females are prone to get decreases in old age and body metabolism is not strong enough to grow a baby inside.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, many countries around the world face economic problems in which citizens are unable to live by earning from one job, hence a majority of nations' individuals work day and night. Therefore, young married couples hold a view that they won't be able to feed another human when their economy is not stable. As an example, many Sri Lankans living in other countries get married at a very small age and have kids when they grow old because first, they try to have money and all the wealth. By doing these outrageous concepts in their real life many people face consequences, such as some many not having babies even if they want to and the age gap between parents and children does not match. \r\n\r\nIn conclusion, there are many disadvantages of not having children at the right age because people follow the new trend and wait until the economy is stable.

Although it has some flaws, I personally perceive that people not only give preference to make their career first but also want to spend time with each other are the main positive reasons which far surpasses its negatives.\r\n\r\nFirst and foremost, the underlying point associated with the trend of children later in life is that couples give importance to their careers. This is because, partners perceive that settling down first by achieving their goals within deadlines, makes them successful person. After that, they provide a much better life for their future children due to they want a child  later in their life. For example,\" The Times\" published in 2020, mostly all famous personalities follow this trend and have babies later, this also helps their children to live a luxurious life.\r\n\r\nMoving on, another worth mentioning favouring attribute is that newly married should have to spend time with each other. To be more specific, new couples try to understand each other by spending quality time together. So that they never face any struggle or misunderstanding in the upcoming future on serious topics. To epitomise, Tim Cooper, from Sheffield Hallam University in the UK, researched and concluded that understanding between couples helps in the growth of children rather than creating issues in front of children.\r\n\r\nHowever, on the contrary, the attributed drawback related to this sometimes twosome have to face consequences for having babies because age affects ,ancestors is said that having a child before 30 years old is best. Despite couples do not have much knowledge, so newly born suffer from myriad issues, so having babies after their 30s is not an issue according to doctors.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, children at a later stage are a favourable concept.

While it may be true that children today have access to more stimulation than ever before, I fear this argument overlooks the many other benefits of story time to both the children and parents.\r\n\r\nThe increased availability of a variety of stories through varied platforms gives children of all ages greater access to new and exciting worlds. Where parents would traditionally be able to share one or two stories in a day, a child today can engage with a different story every hour or two. This helps build creativity and grows a child’s sense of the world around them. Because of the range of mediums, children learn to interpret and engage with a story through other senses beyond just listening. The improved graphics in TV and movies have opened up whole worlds of characters that come to life in a new and exciting way not previously possible.\r\n\r\nHowever, an in-person story allows children to interact with it - asking questions, adding their own creative input and immersing themselves in this new world, with their parents along for the adventure. The interpersonal nature of reading to a child allows them to use their own imagination to create a visual world for the story, an important form of creative expression for growing minds. The aspect of time spent together is also important to a child’s development. In a world where children spend time alone with screens for stimulation from a very young age, it’s important that they also receive one-on-one time with parents to develop interpersonal skills and meaningful relationships. \r\n\r\nThere is no denying that access to a wide range of stimulation for children can provide many of the benefits of traditional storytelling such as stimulating concentration, imagination and curiosity., but in my opinion, it is not a replacement for the tradition of telling stories.

Discuss advantages and disadvantages and give your own opinion.\n\nScore this IELTS Task 2 essay according to the rubric, ensuring alignment with the question:\n\nWith the advent of new technological innovations, the majority of human job roles are becoming replaced by machines at a significant rate. This trend may potentially enhance the productivity and efficiency in the final output, but may also involve some significant drawbacks.\r\n\r\nTo begin with, the industrial, fast moving consumer goods and many other sectors have adapted robots and machines in prodcutions. This has proven to be successfull as these technologies have improved productivity and efficiency of tasks done by machines compared to humans. In addition, automated technology might potentially reduce errors that could be high with the involvement of a man. For example, Japanese organizations firmly believe in using automation in manufacturing where scientific research has proven that machines could improve prodcutivity by 80% compared to humans. Therefore. it is evident that automated technology could provide myraid of benefits. \r\n\r\nDespite the obvious advantages, replacing human job roles with modern technological innovations might cause severe drawbacks. Firstly, this would severely hit the job market where individuals will be challenged to find suitable occupations. A prime example, in the UK, due to emergence of Covid-19 many supermarkets have installed automated machines replacing cashiers resulting to increase unemployment rate in the country. Secondly, when all aspects get machinized, people tend to be physicaly inactive causing potential health issues. For instance, stress and anxiety owing to lack of jobs and inactive lifestyle as a result of automation. Hence, the drawbacks are clear. \r\n\r\nIn my view. I strongly believe that we should strike a balance between what need to be automated and what should not. Although, machines and robot technology would improve productivity and efficiency to a certain level, customer service related occupations need to be man oriented as machines cannot replace the personal touch. \r\n\r\nIn conclusion, automated technology replacing humans would certainly create drawbacks and benefits.

In some industries, the recruiters feel that the interpersonal competencies of most job seekers have more value than their academic qualifications. I moderately agree with this opinion. This essay will discuss the reasons for my point of view.\n\nTo begin with, it is important to note that communication is an integral part of every work environment. Apart from interacting with clients, an employee needs to demonstrate social competency when relating with their colleagues to foster a healthy work space which in turn breeds organisation success. For instance, in my place of work, I have noticed that there is increased productivity when we work as a team with little to no conflict. However, in cases when there is a disagreement, there is less efficiency in achieving a task. This proves that good communication which results from good social skills promotes productiveness in every business establishment.\n\nOn the other hand, the educational accomplishments of an individual seeking a job are equally essential. This is because most professional jobs require a certain amount of skills and knowledge that is acquired through learning. To illustrate, only individuals that have received academic training as a nurse or a medical doctor should be allowed to carry out medical treatments and procedures for ailing individuals. Anything otherwise would result in hazards or loss of life whether the employee has good interpersonal skills or not.\n\nTo sum it up, this essay has explained why social skills as well as academic eligibility should equally be considered by employers when they decide to hire for a role.

Other people believe that children should be taught this at home. \n Discuss both opinions and give your own opinion.\n\nScore this IELTS Task 2 essay according to the rubric, ensuring alignment with the question:\n\nIt is very important to recycle materials and reduce the amount of waste, and teach these principles to the children, but there is a disagreement among the experts about the appropriate place for educating the children. Some believe schools are the best place for teaching the value of recycling, whereas others consider homes as the best location. This essay will discuss both points of view and I shall argue that the children should be educated about this important issue at home.\r\n\r\nOn the one hand, some believe that like most of the other learning, the value of recycling waste should also be taught at home. The process of learning for a toddler begins even before he joins a school. Because, children spend much more time at their homes and tend to follow the habits of their parents, the home is the best place to teach this important value. For instance, it is well known that babies begin to form habits during early childhood. The foundation of many good habits such as reading and self discipline is laid at home. Therefore, they argue that the education about material recycling should be given at the home.\r\n\r\nOne the other hand, I would argue that these valuable habits should be inculcated at the school. It is well established that children listen to their teachers more than the parents, and at school they also learn by observing the behaviour of their peers. Schools provide the perfect atmosphere for learning because of a formal and enabling environment. If information about the value of recycling the waste is shared in school along with a practical demonstration, the children are more likely to retain this information and practice this at their homes. For example, a recent Swedish study demonstrated that on average the students retain more information which is taught at school compared to the one provided at home. \r\n\r\nIn conclusion, though there are convincing arguments on both sides, it is abundantly clear that because children are more likely to learn more and better in schools, they ought to be educated about this important issue in schools.\n\nProvide your assessment in the specified JSON format."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"per_criterion\": [{\"name\": \"Task Response\", \"band\": 8.5, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"this essay will discuss both points of view and I shall argue that the children should be educated about this important issue at home.\", \"the education about material recycling should be given at the home.\", \"it is abundantly clear that because children are more likely to learn more and better in schools, they ought to be educated about this important issue in schools.\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"One the other hand\", \"type\": \"grammatical error\", \"fix\": \"One the other hand should be corrected to On the other hand\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Ensure clarity in the introduction by explicitly stating the thesis and the structure of the essay.\", \"Provide more specific examples or evidence to support the arguments made for both sides.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Coherence & Cohesion\", \"band\": 7.5, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"this essay will discuss both points of view and I shall argue that the children should be educated about this important issue at home.\", \"the home is the best place to teach this important value.\", \"it is abundantly clear that because children are more likely to learn more and better in schools, they ought to be educated about this important issue in schools.\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"One the other hand\", \"type\": \"lexical error\", \"fix\": \"One the other hand should be corrected to On the other hand\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Use clearer transitional phrases to enhance the flow between contrasting ideas.\", \"Ensure consistent terminology when referring to the same concepts, such as 'recycling' and 'waste recycling', to avoid confusion.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Lexical Resource\", \"band\": 7.5, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"the value of recycling waste should also be taught at home\", \"the education about material recycling should be given at the home\", \"children listen to their teachers more than the parents\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"One the other hand\", \"type\": \"lexical error\", \"fix\": \"On the other hand\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Incorporate a wider range of vocabulary related to environmental education to enhance lexical variety.\", \"Use more sophisticated phrases to express ideas, such as 'instilling values' instead of 'teaching the value'.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Grammatical Range & Accuracy\", \"band\": 8.5, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"the value of recycling waste should also be taught at home\", \"the education about material recycling should be given at the home\", \"they ought to be educated about this important issue in schools\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"One the other hand\", \"type\": \"phrase error\", \"fix\": \"On the other hand\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Vary sentence structures further by incorporating more complex sentences.\", \"Ensure consistent use of articles, such as 'the' before 'home' in all instances.\"]}], \"overall\": 8.0}"}]}

From my standpoint, the better the sports conveniences where, the better the public health there. \n    It has been proven that people can improve health of themselves without sports facilities. For instance, they can be much healthier if they avoid eating too much junk food. If he or she is inclined to eat meals that are  rich in vitamins or go to the doctor's on a regular basis with the aim of increasing his or her condition, they definitely manage to do it irrespective of what sport facilities created by governments.

Above all, inhabitants provided with enough conditions to do sports activities can improve their fitness. Clearly indicating, locals, especially youngsters who are dynamic and energetic are not enabled to join in sports centres if special conveniences are not available in the area where they live in, as a result, they become deprived of making profits from conveniences supplied. Thus, a lack of opportunities may appear as an obstacle to have a healthy lifestyle.

The fans are spending their leisure time in order to observe the piece of arts and ruins. The major target is controversial whether they should be full of joy. For instance, Anatolian Museum, which is in my city, celebrates European Museum Day every 18th May. They ask for some artist and students to tell the stories.

Due to, if they learnt their cultural heritage, they would be aware of importance of all ages, all humanity. \nOn the other hand, some individuals have just merged to amuse in the museums. They do not care about history. However, they can adjust to the contemporary art galleries. When the people tend to the these types of activities, they can change to a better person who is indulgent, open-minded, intelligent. For instance, a local science-fiction conseptional ones are initiated in these days, particularly for the youth. Not only to join a part of the conventional museum, also modern galleries can be developed because the minority of the citizens is interested in only future based ones. Meanwhile, they can spend time both on amusement and learning.\nIn conclusion, even the museums cannot learned to the public about the past ages, they can enlighten about the future.

What are the causes of this? What can be done to solve this problem?\n\nScore this IELTS Task 2 essay according to the rubric, ensuring alignment with the question:\n\nAt the present, ecosystem suffers from the change of environment and human disturbance including trash and waste from consumer goods. Therefore, most people sat that manufacture of goods provides direct damage to the natural environment. This essay describes the causes and possible solution to decline this impact. \n\n\nTo begin with, most synthetic material such as plastic, nylon, and other polymers cannot be decomposed by scavenger and microorganism in the ecosystem. Thus, due to this property of the material, some sort of trash such as plastic bag and bottle will remain for more than thousand of years. However, even if these materials are unable to decompose, it can degrade into smaller pieces called microplastic, which can contaminate the soil or air. Moreover, microplastic can be absorbed by other organisms through the digestive system and blood vessel, which is a major cause of various diseases including cancer in human. According to a survey by WHO, 80% of fishes and sea creatures in the market are polluted with microplastic. As a result, it transfers to human through consumption. Additionally, the production of modern products usually releases greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide and CFC that cause severe damages on the ozone layer of the atmosphere. Hence, higher production lead to higher risk of climate change. As can be seen, there are giant gaps of the ozone layer above industrial areas of China. \n\n\nOn the other hand, there are several solutions to tackle this problem. First of all, nowadays, scientists succeeded in developing eco-friendly materials such as chitin and pectin made of organic substances. Therefore, the governments of some countries such as Taiwan encourage people to use this sort of material by reducing the production cost. At the present, there is a dramatic decline in the amount of microplastic contaminated in fish and blood vessel of Taiwanese. Furthermore, the government should limit the number greenhouse gases released into the air by factories. For example, the Canadian government launched a policy to control the amount of greenhouse gases as well as product manufacturing annually. \n\n\nTo sum up, although customer goods provide convenience for people, pathway of production and trash are detrimental to the biosphere. Nevertheless, individuals can help to solve this problem by promoting eco-friendly goods and raising the awareness of its impacts on the environment.\n\nProvide your assessment in the specified JSON format."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"per_criterion\": [{\"name\": \"Task Response\", \"band\": 7.5, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"This essay describes the causes and possible solution to decline this impact.\", \"there are several solutions to tackle this problem.\", \"individuals can help to solve this problem by promoting eco-friendly goods and raising the awareness of its impacts on the environment.\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"most people sat that manufacture of goods provides direct damage to the natural environment\", \"type\": \"clarity\", \"fix\": \"most people say that the manufacture of goods causes direct damage to the natural environment\"}, {\"span\": \"the amount of microplastic contaminated in fish and blood vessel of Taiwanese\", \"type\": \"clarity\", \"fix\": \"the amount of microplastic contamination in fish and the blood vessels of Taiwanese people\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Clarify the introduction by explicitly stating the main points that will be discussed in the essay.\", \"Ensure consistent use of terminology, such as 'microplastics' instead of 'microplastic' for grammatical accuracy.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Coherence & Cohesion\", \"band\": 6.5, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"This essay describes the causes and possible solution to decline this impact.\", \"On the other hand, there are several solutions to tackle this problem.\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"most people sat that manufacture of goods provides direct damage to the natural environment\", \"type\": \"grammatical error affecting clarity\", \"fix\": \"most people say that the manufacture of goods causes direct damage to the natural environment\"}, {\"span\": \"the amount of microplastic contaminated in fish and blood vessel of Taiwanese\", \"type\": \"preposition error affecting clarity\", \"fix\": \"the amount of microplastic contamination in fish and blood vessels of Taiwanese people\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Use clearer transitions between ideas to enhance flow, such as 'Furthermore' or 'In addition' to connect related points.\", \"Ensure subject-verb agreement and correct verb forms to improve grammatical accuracy and clarity.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Lexical Resource\", \"band\": 6.5, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"the production of modern products usually releases greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide and CFC that cause severe damages on the ozone layer of the atmosphere\", \"scientists succeeded in developing eco-friendly materials such as chitin and pectin made of organic substances\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"most people sat that manufacture of goods provides direct damage to the natural environment\", \"type\": \"word choice\", \"fix\": \"most people say that the manufacture of goods causes direct damage to the natural environment\"}, {\"span\": \"higher production lead to higher risk of climate change\", \"type\": \"subject-verb agreement\", \"fix\": \"higher production leads to a higher risk of climate change\"}, {\"span\": \"the amount of microplastic contaminated in fish and blood vessel of Taiwanese\", \"type\": \"preposition use\", \"fix\": \"the amount of microplastic contamination in fish and blood vessels of Taiwanese\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Use more precise vocabulary to convey ideas clearly and accurately.\", \"Pay attention to subject-verb agreement to improve grammatical accuracy.\", \"Practice using appropriate prepositions to enhance the clarity of expressions.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Grammatical Range & Accuracy\", \"band\": 7.5, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"most synthetic material such as plastic, nylon, and other polymers cannot be decomposed by scavenger and microorganism in the ecosystem.\", \"the production of modern products usually releases greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide and CFC that cause severe damages on the ozone layer of the atmosphere.\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"most people sat that manufacture of goods provides direct damage\", \"type\": \"verb tense\", \"fix\": \"most people say that the manufacture of goods provides direct damage\"}, {\"span\": \"higher production lead to higher risk of climate change\", \"type\": \"subject-verb agreement\", \"fix\": \"higher production leads to a higher risk of climate change\"}, {\"span\": \"the amount of microplastic contaminated in fish and blood vessel of Taiwanese\", \"type\": \"preposition usage\", \"fix\": \"the amount of microplastic contamination in fish and blood vessels of Taiwanese\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Ensure subject-verb agreement is maintained throughout the essay.\", \"Use the correct verb tense consistently to convey the intended meaning.\", \"Pay attention to preposition usage to enhance clarity and accuracy.\"]}], \"overall\": 7.0}"}]}

As security has become the major reason among people to protect themselves while living in the new area because people want to have more safety. Secondly, background check is must to get the records of the area that if the property was stolen or anything which was dangerous .For instance, sometimes the buildings are owned/sold by other people and they live for so many years and suddenly the real owner might come to take possession of that building. So, checking the past records of building has become very important for people.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, availability of information resources can be taken from police or people living in the neighbour .

However, others believe that these are leading to the loss of national identities. Discuss both views and give your own opinion\n\nScore this IELTS Task 2 essay according to the rubric, ensuring alignment with the question:\n\nIt is true that growing business and cultural contacts are part of the modern process of globalisation. While some people mourn the loss of national identity which they believe occurs as a result of this process, I disagree with that view on the basis that it is important to embrace change and accept new realities. \nThe expansion of business and cultural exchanges across the world is a positive feature of contemporary life. Companies have broken into new markets by doing market research and taking into consideration local differences in consumer demands and preferences. They introduce new products without dismissing traditional ideas. The appearance, for example, of McDonald’s fast food outlets in Malaysia, China or Vietnam is not incompatible with the success of restaurants serving time-honoured cuisine. Such innovations do not necessarily mark the disappearance of traditional ways of life and to accept new customs is to extend choice for every consumer. \nThus, it is an exaggeration to maintain that these developments will lead to the loss of a strong sense of identity in countries. For example, people in many former colonial nations have embraced change, but they still proudly preserve traditional cultural traits. In India, English - the language of the former colonial power - is widely spoken, but this has not led to the disappearance of local languages or indigenous cultural practices. Therefore, joining modern culture does not always mean that national or local customs have to be abandoned. On the contrary, enforced isolation from trade and cultural contacts with other countries will have the inevitable consequence of withdrawal from all the changes taking place globally. \nIn conclusion, I would argue that the growth of contacts in commerce and culture is a positive development which will not destroy national identities.\n\nProvide your assessment in the specified JSON format."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"per_criterion\": [{\"name\": \"Task Response\", \"band\": 8.0, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"the expansion of business and cultural exchanges across the world is a positive feature of contemporary life.\", \"joining modern culture does not always mean that national or local customs have to be abandoned.\"], \"errors\": [], \"suggestions\": [\"Consider providing more specific examples or statistics to further support your argument about the positive effects of globalization.\", \"Elaborate on counterarguments to strengthen your position and demonstrate a deeper understanding of the topic.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Coherence & Cohesion\", \"band\": 7.0, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"the expansion of business and cultural exchanges across the world is a positive feature of contemporary life\", \"joining modern culture does not always mean that national or local customs have to be abandoned\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"the loss of national identity which they believe occurs as a result of this process\", \"type\": \"clarity\", \"fix\": \"rephrase to clarify that the loss of national identity is a perspective rather than a universally accepted fact\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Use clearer transitions between paragraphs to enhance the flow of ideas.\", \"Provide more examples to support the argument about the coexistence of modern culture and traditional identity.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Lexical Resource\", \"band\": 7.0, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"the loss of national identity which they believe occurs as a result of this process\", \"the expansion of business and cultural exchanges across the world is a positive feature of contemporary life\", \"joining modern culture does not always mean that national or local customs have to be abandoned\"], \"errors\": [], \"suggestions\": [\"Incorporate more varied vocabulary to avoid repetition, such as using synonyms for 'change' or 'identity'.\", \"Consider using more complex phrases or idiomatic expressions to enhance the richness of the language.\", \"Explore the use of more precise academic terminology to strengthen arguments and clarity.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Grammatical Range & Accuracy\", \"band\": 8.0, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"Companies have broken into new markets by doing market research and taking into consideration local differences in consumer demands and preferences.\", \"Thus, it is an exaggeration to maintain that these developments will lead to the loss of a strong sense of identity in countries.\"], \"errors\": [], \"suggestions\": [\"Incorporate more complex sentence structures to further enhance grammatical range.\", \"Use a wider variety of linking words and phrases to improve cohesion and coherence.\"]}], \"overall\": 7.5}"}]}

To what extent do you agree or disagree?\n\nScore this IELTS Task 2 essay according to the rubric, ensuring alignment with the question:\n\n\nBusinesses have always sought to make profits but it is becoming increasingly common to hear people talk about the social obligations that companies have .I completely agree with the idea that businesses should do more for society than simply make money.\nOn the one hand, I accept that businesses must make money in order to survive in a comparative word. It seems logical that the priority of any company should be to cover its running costs, such as employees wages and payments for buildings and utilities. On the top of these costs, companies also need to invest in improvements and innovations if they wish to remain successful. If a company is unable to pay its bills or meet the changing needs of the customers, any concerns about social responsibilities become irrelevant. In other words, a company can only make a positive contribution to the society if it is in a good financial health.\nOn the other hand, companies should not be run with the sole aim of maximizing profits. They have a vital role to play in society. One social obligation that owners and managers have is to treat their employees wel,  rather than exploiting them.

I am going to scrutinize both aspects in further paragraphs before forming an opinion in the last.\r\n\r\nTo begin with, on the one side of the coin, there are many reasons for supporting other important subjects in children’s school curriculum; firstly, modern technology like computer literacy has become the need of the hour.  It is one of the most demanded skills for a job in every sector.  If they spend most of their time learning art they will not be able to face the cut-throat competition in this scenario. Moreover, the knowledge of essential subjects like math, and science is highly required in every field. Secondly, Art despite being highly appreciated, still does not ensure any career growth because most fields like engineering, marketing, IT professionals, and managers are found graduated and post graduated in these important subjects.\r\n\r\nOn the other flip side of the coin, art is a creative skill that has wonderful imagination power. It provides the wings to the fantasy and expresses the feelings without the exchange of words. To illustrate, I have come across a painting in which the difference between the rich and poor’s plight was depicted through painting only. Moreover, music is also a piece of art and works as a healing therapy in the hectic world.  Secondly, artists bring laurels to the country across the world and ensure that the cultural heritage of the country may not extinct.  For this, they are highly paid and appreciated.  That kind of respect is no less than a flourished career.

What extent do you agree or disagree?\n\nScore this IELTS Task 2 essay according to the rubric, ensuring alignment with the question:\n\nNowadays, an increasing number of people are concerned about measures to ensure road safety. However, whether imposing stricter penalties for driving offenses is the only way to protect people is still a controversial issue. Although I agree that harsher punishments can act as an effective way to deter people from committing road offenses, I believe that there are better methods to protect the welfare of road users.\r\n\r\nFirstly, it is obvious that the implementation of rules can act as a deterrent to would-be lawbreakers. For example, in Vietnam, a motorist not wearing helmet can be fined with $20 to $40, and thus he will be in fear of facing further punishment and avoid committing another offense. Furthermore, more stringent punishments for traffic crimes can\r\n\r\nbe efficient way to reduce traffic accidents. For instance, in the past, China witnessed a significant number of annual\r\n\r\nroad casualties when it had very loosely enforced regulations. However, once harsher laws related to road safety were implemented in 2009, there was a notable reduction in the total number of traffic accidents.\r\n\r\nThis is not to say that only by using stricter rules can we enhance the safety of our roads. It is true that there are still other effective measures to ensure people’s safety, such as heightening people’s awareness through the media about the consequences of committing driving offenses, or promoting the use of public transport systems such as buses or trains. To achieve the best results, the most effective method may be to combine all the aforementioned ideas.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, I believe that stricter punishments are not the only way to deal with minimizing driving offenses.

The main reasons why it can be effective are a parent's awareness of how a child absorbs information and the use of charisma during the process. Put simply, a parent knows their child better than anyone else and may find the best way to read or tell a story in an entertaining way. In addition, such quality time together may strengthen the bond between a parent and a child.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, giving children access to sources such as books and TV may be as or even more productive. For instance, there are various channels on television, some of which create exceptionally good content that is aimed at educating children. Discovery and National Geographic are some of the most popular examples of educational channels that are also fascinating in many ways. What makes watching such content special is that it is a more sophisticated process than listening to a parent. To be specific, watching a show on National Geographic means looking at images, listening to a narrator, and reading texts when necessary.\r\n\r\nIn my view, providing children with access to specific sources such as the ones mentioned above is a perfect choice. It presents more diversity and challenges a child to learn in a multifaceted way, which is crucial in the era of information overload. Children who read books, watch TV, and view movies may develop better than those who only listen to stories told by their parents.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, it is clear that reading stories to children has its benefits, but familiarizing children with numerous ways to learn is generally better.\n\nProvide your assessment in the specified JSON format."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"per_criterion\": [{\"name\": \"Task Response\", \"band\": 7.0, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"I believe the latter option is more effective because those mentioned sources provide a more sophisticated method to learn.\", \"In my view, providing children with access to specific sources such as the ones mentioned above is a perfect choice.\"], \"errors\": [], \"suggestions\": [\"Expand on the benefits of storytelling by parents to provide a more balanced view.\", \"Include specific examples or studies that support the argument for the effectiveness of alternative sources.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Coherence & Cohesion\", \"band\": 6.0, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"it is essential for parents to read stories to or tell stories to their children\", \"giving children access to sources such as books and TV may be as or even more productive\", \"it presents more diversity and challenges a child to learn in a multifaceted way\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"the latter option is more effective because those mentioned sources provide a more sophisticated method to learn\", \"type\": \"clarity\", \"fix\": \"rephrase to clarify what 'those mentioned sources' refers to\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Use clearer transitions between paragraphs to enhance flow, such as 'Firstly,' 'Secondly,' and 'Finally.'\", \"Ensure that all references to sources are explicitly defined to avoid ambiguity.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Lexical Resource\", \"band\": 6.0, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"it is essential for parents to read stories to or tell stories to their children\", \"such quality time together may strengthen the bond between a parent and a child\", \"it presents more diversity and challenges a child to learn in a multifaceted way\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"the latter option is more effective\", \"type\": \"word choice\", \"fix\": \"the latter option is more effective than the former\"}, {\"span\": \"may develop better than those who only listen to stories told by their parents\", \"type\": \"clarity\", \"fix\": \"may develop better skills than those who only listen to stories told by their parents\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Use more varied vocabulary to avoid repetition, such as using synonyms for 'effective' and 'advantageous'.\", \"Incorporate more complex sentence structures to enhance the sophistication of the writing.\", \"Provide clearer comparisons and contrasts to improve clarity and coherence in arguments.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Grammatical Range & Accuracy\", \"band\": 7.0, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"it is essential for parents to read stories to or tell stories to their children\", \"a parent knows their child better than anyone else\", \"providing children with access to specific sources such as the ones mentioned above is a perfect choice\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"may develop better than those who only listen to stories told by their parents\", \"type\": \"word choice\", \"fix\": \"may develop better than those who only listen to stories told by their parents do\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Vary sentence structures more to enhance the complexity of the writing.\", \"Ensure subject-verb agreement is maintained throughout the essay.\"]}], \"overall\": 6.5}"}]}

In my opinion, I strongly disagree that celebrities set a bad example to young people as celebrities do not ask people to worship them. \nA good reason to not take celebrities as role models is that a celebrity’s role in society is to entertain people, not to set a moral example for young people. For example, celebrities generally want to gain a lot of publicity and achieve fame. Therefore, they want always to be in the spotlight because this is the sole purpose of their job. To cite an example, a movie star in Egypt mentioned in one of his interviews that young people should think twice before imitate other’s behaviors because people always don’t pay any attention to their behaviors in public in many cases.\nAnother point to consider is that, like everyone else, celebrities may have moral shortcomings and make the wrong life choices. Young people don’t know the concept that celebrities make mistakes like us. Due to the lack of experience that young people have, they see celebrities as positive role models in their life to help them to live with hope, integrity, and compassion. As a result, if one of their role models did something wrong; they blindly copy his/her action without thoroughly thinking. For example, a famous football player committed suicide last week because of his financial worries, and consequently, three of his fans were trying to kill themselves by committing suicide as well. \nFinally, parents, teachers, and scientists rather than celebrities should be role models in our society. These people have tremendous positive effects on people’s behaviors. Young people can learn from their parents, how to be more dedicated, and how to behave responsibly in public. Furthermore, young people should be taught that they can be very successful and a very good person at the same time, such as scientists. For instance, Ahmed Zewail, who was awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry for his work in femtochemistry, should be taken as a positive role model for our children. Moreover, teachers, scientists, and parents are needed to compensate for the lack of positive role models among politicians and business people. \nIn conclusion, while celebrities are responsible for their actions and they did not ask young people to take them as role models, there are some people ought to be taken as a moral example such as scientists and parents.\n\nProvide your assessment in the specified JSON format."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"per_criterion\": [{\"name\": \"Task Response\", \"band\": 6.5, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"I strongly disagree that celebrities set a bad example to young people as celebrities do not ask people to worship them.\", \"A good reason to not take celebrities as role models is that a celebrity’s role in society is to entertain people, not to set a moral example for young people.\", \"Finally, parents, teachers, and scientists rather than celebrities should be role models in our society.\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"young people should think twice before imitate other’s behaviors\", \"type\": \"grammar\", \"fix\": \"young people should think twice before imitating others' behaviors\"}, {\"span\": \"they blindly copy his/her action without thoroughly thinking\", \"type\": \"clarity\", \"fix\": \"they blindly copy his/her actions without thorough consideration\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Clarify the argument by providing more specific examples of positive role models among parents, teachers, and scientists.\", \"Strengthen the conclusion by summarizing the main points more clearly and reiterating the importance of alternative role models.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Coherence & Cohesion\", \"band\": 5.5, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"a celebrity’s role in society is to entertain people, not to set a moral example for young people\", \"young people should think twice before imitate other’s behaviors\", \"parents, teachers, and scientists rather than celebrities should be role models in our society\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"before imitate other’s behaviors\", \"type\": \"grammatical error\", \"fix\": \"before imitating others' behaviors\"}, {\"span\": \"there are some people ought to be taken as a moral example\", \"type\": \"awkward phrasing\", \"fix\": \"there are some people who ought to be taken as moral examples\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Use clearer transitions between ideas and paragraphs to enhance flow.\", \"Ensure grammatical accuracy to improve clarity, especially in verb forms and pluralization.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Lexical Resource\", \"band\": 5.5, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"celebrities are well-known because of the image of glamour and fortune associated with them\", \"a celebrity’s role in society is to entertain people, not to set a moral example for young people\", \"these people have tremendous positive effects on people’s behaviors\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"before imitate other’s behaviors\", \"type\": \"word choice\", \"fix\": \"before imitating others' behaviors\"}, {\"span\": \"they blindly copy his/her action\", \"type\": \"subject-verb agreement\", \"fix\": \"they blindly copy his or her actions\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Use a wider range of vocabulary to express ideas more precisely and avoid repetition.\", \"Pay attention to subject-verb agreement and pluralization in sentences.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Grammatical Range & Accuracy\", \"band\": 6.5, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"a celebrity’s role in society is to entertain people, not to set a moral example for young people.\", \"Due to the lack of experience that young people have, they see celebrities as positive role models in their life to help them to live with hope, integrity, and compassion.\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"before imitate other’s behaviors\", \"type\": \"subject-verb agreement\", \"fix\": \"before imitating others' behaviors\"}, {\"span\": \"they blindly copy his/her action\", \"type\": \"subject-verb agreement\", \"fix\": \"they blindly copy his or her actions\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Use gerunds after prepositions to improve grammatical accuracy, e.g., 'before imitating' instead of 'before imitate'.\", \"Ensure subject-verb agreement and pluralization are consistent, e.g., 'actions' instead of 'action' when referring to multiple role models.\"]}], \"overall\": 6.0}"}]}

Therefore, there has been so much discussion revolving around the issue of whether government ought to concentrate on improving these issues to contribute to reducing the rate of human beings who are suffering from illness. The reasons why I partially agree will  be provided in this essay.\r\n\r\nTo begin with, I opine that these complicated harmful problems will be only solved by administrations and they have potential effects on us. As our planet is becoming more toxic, a variety of unheard diseases have been identified in the modern society. Not only that, houses in urban areas are tuning into more sacrifice presences because a multitude of citizens want to move to these areas. If we have to escape from these phenomenons, the only thing we are able to rely is the authority. For instance, executives can increase the number of jobs in the countrysides to prevent housing crisis. In addition, they have power to control or limit the overwhelming use of chemical substances. That is why I cannot disagree with the statement.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, individuals should put effort and energy to keep themselves from diseases as well. These troubles are not only related to environments but also a considerable number of factors exist. Among them, personal lifestyles have the most major effect. For example, a person who has consumed loads of stimulatively sugary or salty food is more likely to have diabetes and heart disease than a human who has had meals healthily  according to the study. Thus, I totally believe that every single person's trying is needed as well.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, I admit that the administration's control has to be involved to advance the places where we live in as it is the only institute that is holding a key.

While some people think that disrespect and indiscipline are the unavoidable aftermath of this approach, I would contend it would result in increased educational quality.\n\n\nOn the one hand, there is a common belief that enabling students to judge teachers may undermine students’ sense of respect and discipline. High school students are generally immature, inexperienced and impulsive; they tend to lose their temper and overreact each time they are disciplined by the teachers. The problem is even worse when all the students see their peers criticising the teachers. They may think of such action as a right way to behave and start to imitate it. As a result, the classroom learning environment can be filled with disrespect and indiscipline.\n\n\nOn the other hand, I side with those who believe that giving students the total freedom in expressing their thoughts and feelings towards teachers may enhance educational standards. Many countries are promoting students-centred teaching with two-way communication, where open discussions between teachers and students are encouraged. This approach has a clear advantage of making students become proactive in studying. It also provides teachers with a chance to better their pedagogical skills by receiving feedbacks from students. By this way, both the learners and the educators can achieve higher academically.\n\n\nIn conclusion, the educational of encouraging high school students to judge their teachers may undoubtedly lead to enhanced academic achievements, despite the possibility that a disrespectful and undisciplined attitude amongst the class.\n\nProvide your assessment in the specified JSON format."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"per_criterion\": [{\"name\": \"Task Response\", \"band\": 6.0, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"I would contend it would result in increased educational quality.\", \"giving students the total freedom in expressing their thoughts and feelings towards teachers may enhance educational standards.\", \"the educational of encouraging high school students to judge their teachers may undoubtedly lead to enhanced academic achievements\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"the educational of encouraging high school students\", \"type\": \"clarity\", \"fix\": \"the practice of encouraging high school students\"}, {\"span\": \"feedbacks from students\", \"type\": \"word choice\", \"fix\": \"feedback from students\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Clarify the conclusion by summarizing the main arguments more explicitly.\", \"Provide more specific examples or evidence to support the claims made about the benefits of student feedback.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Coherence & Cohesion\", \"band\": 5.0, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"there is a common belief that enabling students to judge teachers may undermine students’ sense of respect and discipline\", \"giving students the total freedom in expressing their thoughts and feelings towards teachers may enhance educational standards\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"the educational of encouraging high school students to judge their teachers\", \"type\": \"grammatical error\", \"fix\": \"the practice of encouraging high school students to judge their teachers\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Use clearer topic sentences to guide the reader through each paragraph's main idea.\", \"Ensure that transitions between ideas are smoother to enhance the flow of the essay.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Lexical Resource\", \"band\": 5.0, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"the unavoidable aftermath of this approach\", \"students-centred teaching with two-way communication\", \"the educational of encouraging high school students to judge their teachers\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"the educational of encouraging high school students to judge their teachers\", \"type\": \"word choice\", \"fix\": \"the concept of encouraging high school students to judge their teachers\"}, {\"span\": \"feedbacks from students\", \"type\": \"pluralization\", \"fix\": \"feedback from students\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Use more varied vocabulary to express ideas clearly and accurately.\", \"Avoid using incorrect plural forms of uncountable nouns such as 'feedback'.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Grammatical Range & Accuracy\", \"band\": 6.0, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"I would contend it would result in increased educational quality.\", \"Many countries are promoting students-centred teaching with two-way communication.\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"the educational of encouraging high school students\", \"type\": \"word choice\", \"fix\": \"the practice of encouraging high school students\"}, {\"span\": \"feedbacks from students\", \"type\": \"pluralization\", \"fix\": \"feedback from students\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Use more varied sentence structures to improve grammatical range.\", \"Ensure correct word forms and phrases are used for clarity.\"]}], \"overall\": 5.5}"}]}

In recent times, some individuals decide to give birth at a later age. Although there are some benefits attached to that, such as mental and emotional maturity, as well as financial stability, however, there are also risks of having a baby with deformity, not being able to give children optimum parenting due to unavailability, which I believe outweigh the benefits. \r\n\r\nTo begin, so many people in this modern society would rather prefer to pursue their career first, get a job and have a steady income before venturing into marriage and childbearing. Their reason is that it makes it very easy to train the children without having to face the challenges of finance, as such children mostly lack nothing. For instance, when one is financially buoyant, they can afford to train their children to any level of education. More so, some people also think that it’s better to be mentally mature enough to be able to face the emotional ups and downs that come with childbearing and parenting. \r\n\r\nOn the other hand, as some people are busy pursuing their careers, they tend to forget that age is not on their side, hence old age increases one’s chances of giving birth to abnormal babies. Furthermore, when parents are busy  and so engulfed with their job, they have little or no time to monitor their youngsters and attend to their needs. In addition, early retirement age might catch up with one, thereby affecting their income, and besides, old age comes with weakness and poses the risk of lack of energy required to control children. For instance, an elderly man who has  a two-year-old toddler would find it tasking to walk the baby around the house.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, in as much as there are advantages to early childbearing and upbringing such as a steady income, and mental and emotional maturity, the disadvantages which include, lack of availability due to busy schedules, and having babies with congenital anomalies exceed the advantages.\n\nProvide your assessment in the specified JSON format."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"per_criterion\": [{\"name\": \"Task Response\", \"band\": 6.5, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"there are also risks of having a baby with deformity, not being able to give children optimum parenting due to unavailability, which I believe outweigh the benefits.\", \"the disadvantages which include, lack of availability due to busy schedules, and having babies with congenital anomalies exceed the advantages.\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"however, there are also risks of having a baby with deformity, not being able to give children optimum parenting due to unavailability, which I believe outweigh the benefits.\", \"type\": \"clarity and coherence\", \"fix\": \"Rephrase to clarify the relationship between the benefits and risks, and avoid using 'however' incorrectly.\"}, {\"span\": \"in as much as there are advantages to early childbearing and upbringing such as a steady income, and mental and emotional maturity\", \"type\": \"relevance\", \"fix\": \"Ensure that the advantages mentioned directly relate to the main argument about the timing of childbearing.\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Clearly state the thesis in the introduction to guide the reader on the main argument.\", \"Ensure that each paragraph directly supports the thesis with clear examples and connections to the main argument.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Coherence & Cohesion\", \"band\": 5.5, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"Although there are some benefits attached to that, such as mental and emotional maturity, as well as financial stability, however, there are also risks of having a baby with deformity, not being able to give children optimum parenting due to unavailability, which I believe outweigh the benefits.\", \"To begin, so many people in this modern society would rather prefer to pursue their career first, get a job and have a steady income before venturing into marriage and childbearing.\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"however, there are also risks of having a baby with deformity, not being able to give children optimum parenting due to unavailability, which I believe outweigh the benefits.\", \"type\": \"conjunction misuse\", \"fix\": \"Remove 'however' or replace it with 'but' to maintain proper contrast.\"}, {\"span\": \"For instance, an elderly man who has  a two-year-old toddler would find it tasking to walk the baby around the house.\", \"type\": \"lack of clarity\", \"fix\": \"Clarify the example to better connect it to the argument about age and parenting challenges.\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Use clearer transitions between ideas to enhance flow, such as replacing 'however' with 'but' for clearer contrast.\", \"Ensure that examples directly support the main argument to improve clarity and relevance.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Lexical Resource\", \"band\": 5.5, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"mental and emotional maturity\", \"financial stability\", \"lack of availability due to busy schedules\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"not being able to give children optimum parenting due to unavailability\", \"type\": \"word choice\", \"fix\": \"not being able to provide children with optimal parenting due to unavailability\"}, {\"span\": \"old age increases one’s chances of giving birth to abnormal babies\", \"type\": \"word choice\", \"fix\": \"old age increases one’s chances of giving birth to babies with abnormalities\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Use more precise vocabulary to enhance clarity, such as replacing 'optimum' with 'optimal'.\", \"Avoid redundancy in phrases;

Others say individuals should save during their working years to fund their own retirement. What is your opinion? Give reasons for your answer and include examples from your own experience.\n\nScore this IELTS Task 2 essay according to the rubric, ensuring alignment with the question:\n\nSome people believe that the government should take care of old people and provide financial support after they retire. Others say individuals should save during their working years to fund their own retirement. What is your opinion? Give reasons for your answer and include examples from your own experience.\n\nIt is true that when people advance into their golden years, they require more help and attention. For that reason, a significant number of people hold the opinion that the government should provide financial assistance to the elderly. However, I tend to agree with those who argue that workers should be saving a portion of their income to have a nest egg in their retirement.\n\nTo begin with, a culture of saving rather than depending on the government may foster the overall economic development of a country. In other words, if people were to accumulate their own savings for their pension age, it would lessen the financial burden on the government. As a result, the government would be able to release more funds to more productive purposes, such as development of infrastructure, industries, hospitals, and so on, which may expedite the overall progression of a country.\n\nIn addition to economic factors, putting money aside has some personal benefits. Since savings-oriented people are not dependent on the state for their living expenses, this may instill a sense of self-respect and pride in them. On the other hand, those who are reliant on financial assistance very often face the negative societal stigma, as many people consider them to be inferior and unworthy members of society. Hence, to live a life with dignity and pride, taking responsibility for funding one’s own retirement is evidently a better option from individual perspective.\n\nIn contrast, the provision of monetary outlays for retirees has proven unfeasible in many countries. Since in many nations the number of senior citizens is on the rise, in the long run governments are likely to struggle to sustain the cost of providing for the elderly.

Others believe the effect of modern music is positive.\r\nDiscuss both these views and give your opinion\n\nScore this IELTS Task 2 essay according to the rubric, ensuring alignment with the question:\n\nIssues related to modern music are frequently discussed these days. Some people believe that music today has a negative impact on the youngest people. Others criticize and argue that modern music can positively affect the young. Both sides of view and the explanation will be discussed in the following paragraphs.\r\n\r\nOn the one hand, there are several reasons why the effect of the digital age music shows negative ways. The principal reason is that the young lack  careful thought about good and bad things. To explain, most adolescents are usually influenced by their favourite artists in terms of following styles as well as characteristics. Hence, some impolite actions, such as smoking and shouting, can lead their younger fans to follow. For instance, in Thailand, some boys try to smoke in the classroom since they want to be like their favourite rappers in the show without thinking of the drawbacks of smoking.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, opponents may argue that the modern style of rhythms has a greater impact on the younger generation. The main point is that most children always have a lot of energy; thus, dancing with modern rhythm can be a great solution for releasing their powers without fighting. This means that relaxing with melody is one of the suitable sports categories in the young age group. \r\n\r\nFor example, today most children like to dance with the popular music in Tik-Tok applications.\r\n\r\nAnother point of the merits is that listen to music in younger people, such as the classical style, can have a positive result in the enhancement of their brains according to many kinds of research. To exemplify, many English teachers use  music in order to teach their pupils as these lyrics can lead pupils to concentrate on the lessons more than reading a book.\r\n\r\nAll things considered; I am of the opinion that the advantages of modern singing significantly outweigh the disadvantages in many aspects. Therefore, parents and media’s organizations should share responsibilities and have an awareness of their offspring as well as the future generation.\n\nProvide your assessment in the specified JSON format."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"per_criterion\": [{\"name\": \"Task Response\", \"band\": 6.5, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"Some people believe that music today has a negative impact on the youngest people.\", \"the advantages of modern singing significantly outweigh the disadvantages in many aspects.\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"the young lack  careful thought about good and bad things\", \"type\": \"clarity\", \"fix\": \"rephrase to clarify what 'good and bad things' refers to in the context of music.\"}, {\"span\": \"the modern style of rhythms has a greater impact on the younger generation\", \"type\": \"specificity\", \"fix\": \"provide specific examples of how modern rhythms positively impact the younger generation.\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Include more specific examples to support claims about the positive effects of modern music.\", \"Clarify the argument by explicitly stating the main points for both sides before concluding.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Coherence & Cohesion\", \"band\": 5.5, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"the effect of the digital age music shows negative ways\", \"the modern style of rhythms has a greater impact on the younger generation\", \"the advantages of modern singing significantly outweigh the disadvantages in many aspects\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"the effect of the digital age music shows negative ways\", \"type\": \"clarity\", \"fix\": \"rephrase to 'the effects of modern digital music can be negative'\"}, {\"span\": \"listen to music in younger people\", \"type\": \"grammatical error\", \"fix\": \"change to 'listening to music among young people'\"}, {\"span\": \"the young age group\", \"type\": \"vagueness\", \"fix\": \"specify as 'young children or adolescents'\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Use clearer topic sentences to guide the reader through each paragraph's main idea.\", \"Ensure grammatical accuracy, especially with verb forms and prepositions, to enhance clarity.\", \"Improve transitions between ideas to create a smoother flow of information.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Lexical Resource\", \"band\": 5.5, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"the effect of the digital age music shows negative ways\", \"the modern style of rhythms has a greater impact on the younger generation\", \"the advantages of modern singing significantly outweigh the disadvantages\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"the young lack careful thought about good and bad things\", \"type\": \"word choice\", \"fix\": \"the youth lack careful consideration of right and wrong\"}, {\"span\": \"the suitable sports categories in the young age group\", \"type\": \"word choice\", \"fix\": \"suitable activities for young people\"}, {\"span\": \"listen to music in younger people\", \"type\": \"grammar\", \"fix\": \"listening to music among young people\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Use more varied vocabulary to express ideas, such as synonyms for 'young' and 'music'.\", \"Improve grammatical accuracy by ensuring subject-verb agreement and correct preposition use.\", \"Incorporate more complex sentence structures to enhance the overall sophistication of the writing.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Grammatical Range & Accuracy\", \"band\": 6.5, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"the young lack careful thought about good and bad things\", \"the modern style of rhythms has a greater impact on the younger generation\", \"the advantages of modern singing significantly outweigh the disadvantages in many aspects\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"listen to music in younger people\", \"type\": \"subject-verb agreement\", \"fix\": \"listening to music among younger people\"}, {\"span\": \"the young age group\", \"type\": \"awkward phrasing\", \"fix\": \"the younger age group\"}, {\"span\": \"media’s organizations\", \"type\": \"incorrect possessive form\", \"fix\": \"media organizations\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Use gerunds to improve clarity and grammatical accuracy, such as changing 'listen to music in younger people' to 'listening to music among younger people'.\", \"Avoid awkward phrasing by rephrasing sentences for better flow, such as changing 'the young age group' to 'the younger age group'.\", \"Ensure correct use of possessive forms by using 'media organizations' instead of 'media’s organizations'.\"]}], \"overall\": 6.0}"}]}

While many individuals suppose that these individuals should accept that due to their considerable fame, I hold the opposite viewpoint.\r\n\r\nIt is undeniable that some individuals who work as celebrities, such as actors, models, etc., suffer from the pressure of society on their professional and personal lifestyles. The media enterprises do this to obtain more notoriety and ratings for their prestigious companies. Therefore, they frequently invade their privacy by highlighting terrible circumstances in front of the public, which is considered a disgraceful act.

This will have a detrimental impact on her reputation and credibility.\r\n\r\nMoreover, I believe that each resident has their own privacy because every person is a separate individual. Thus, the unduplicated individual has the right to live and do everything they enjoy without breaking the law.

In fact, office duties are sufficient for almost all individuals because they do not require a physical requirement. Besides, it is obvious that, whether they are a lady or a gentleman, artwork is one of the fields best performed by both of them.

Therefore, if schools  provide teamwork more, students with the same aims and views can be friends at the time of working together. A good case in point is that in America more percentage of the public met their best friends at the time  school ages in staff and still chat with each other.\r\n\r\n      On the other hand, sports is a more contact type of event and it can change students like introverts. This kinda thing recycles teenagers' point of view, they will understand that it will be faster and easier to do practises or complete your dreams. This is to say that contact with others and taking their help can update the public in the best way. For example, in England number of extroverts has risen after they made massive changes in school sports facilities and after adding more lessons in physical education.

Secondly, children can be more healthy, commanly sports make them physically and mentally stronger, which is one of the most important thing for kids.

In this regard, there is a highly controversial issue among people that international growth brings tremendous benefits to countries, whereas others reckon that it can lead to forgetting the culture. As far as I am concerned, all people around the world have the same rights and dignity so it is essential that governments provide interactions with other countries. Here,  both views will be discussed.\r\n\r\nFrom one point of view, cultures are part of human beings' identity which require to be protected strictly. Unfortunately, by developing science and technology more and more people have forgotten some national cultures like celebrating the feasts, thanksgiving or even the importance of Christmas day. Also, some cultures, especially in developing countries, have been driven from developed countries. For example, Halloween was not popular in Islamic countries though ,by emerging social media, many youngsters celebrate this day by wearing different costumes. Therefore, parents and teachers play an important role by reminding the value of culture to children .\r\n\r\nFrom another point of view, globalization makes the world to be connected to each other. As a consequence, students can have a chance to communicate with other educators from all around the world. For instance, student exchange has become mainstream which can give an opportunity to students to go abroad for a year to continue their education and get known other nationalities. Plus, businesses have shown great financial advantages by expanding their branches to other companies. Also, the rate of employment is significantly increased by constructing the organizations in developing nations that contribute to a better economy.\r\n\r\nTo put it in a nutshell, by respecting to whole views mentioned above, it is not acceptable to ignore  globalization to protect  cultural identities.

Businesses are encouraged to move to rural areas . Do the advantages outweigh the disadvantages ?\n\nScore this IELTS Task 2 essay according to the rubric, ensuring alignment with the question:\n\nIt has been observed that residential issues,as well as transportation ,problems have been rising at an alarming rate in the urban areas. Therefore, to overcome these, large occupations have to shift their infrastructures toward the countryside. The merits of this situation are more than the demerits which will discuss below.\n\nTo embark, the foremost advantage is it will reduce the unnecessary traffic congestion in cities. To elaborate on this, nowadays  increasing numbers of people commute to work at different locations in cities from the rural areas at the same time. However, if the location of their organizations is changed then there will be  fewer traffic jams in peak hours of the day. As a result, the rate of road traffic accidents may decrease. Another one is, that poverty will reduce in  underdeveloped areas. This means  that employment opportunities may arise in rural sites  if large industries will shift to that sites. So, individuals do not have to go to larger cities in order to find a job and they can earn money.

I disagree, as no parent would ever encourage his or her child to become a criminal, and punishing the parents for the fault of one child would be unfair to the other siblings.\n\n\nParents, no matter how many offences they have committed themselves, would never persuade their infant to break the constitution. That is to say, parents have an innate desire, to raise their teenager to become a successful, case-abiding citizen. However, kids these days hardly ever listen to their parents, and yearn for independence, at a very early age, from their parents and statute. For instance, a recent survey in the UK showed, almost 80% of the children who were caught shoplifting, were already being seriously condemned and punished by their parents. \n\n\nAnother reason I am against punishing the parents for the crimes of their infant is that this would be unfair to the other innocent siblings. They have done nothing wrong, and thus, don’t deserve to have their parents taken away from them. Putting their parents in jail would also increase their chances of following the bad path and the whole family would be destroyed. Children raised in social care centres and foster homes are known to have 10 times more personality disorders and violent temperaments.\n\n\nIn conclusion, parents should not be convicted for their children breaking the case, as they try their best to deter them from doing so.

While several people think that if the government makes some arrangements to educate the prisoner, perhaps crime will be deterred, I believe that educating the people only in prison could not solve this phenomenon.\r\n\r\nIt is distinct that education discourages people from becoming involved in illegal works. For example, in America, research shows that many people who do not have minimum education level or any training to get a good job commit crimes the most. This is because when a person does not get any job, he might be getting involved in foul deeds for their livelihood. Hence, the government should take responsibility to educate the underprivileged persons before they do any terrible job.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, The jail authority might introduce some job training for the prisoner; thus, they can acquire knowledge about a particular work, and after imprisonment, they could get a better job opportunity to earn their bread and butter. Moreover, prisoners should go through counselling arranged by mental health professionals, which will help them understand how harmful their works are for the nation.

As a result, within some months, there has been a change seen among the criminals.\r\n\r\nTo conclude, it seems that education is the most significant way to reduce crimes in society, but in my perspective, it will not be fruitful to educate only the prisoners.

Other people think that it is a waste of valuable school time. What do you think?\n\nScore this IELTS Task 2 essay according to the rubric, ensuring alignment with the question:\n\nThe strength and prospect for the global media to shape the views of today’s youth and to educate them are significant. However, while some opine that the global media and international news, as part of education, have no important impact on secondary education, others believe that international news should be studied by those pupils to reap its benefits. This essay attempts to examine the issue by diving deep into it. I believe that international news as part of the secondary education syllabus is important.\r\n\r\nOn the one hand, global media enriches young people's understanding of contemporary affairs and enhances their views and perspectives. It is due to the fact that international affairs, as part of education, not only make them more conscious and knowledgeable but also connect global youths on the same platforms. For example, a study run by Oxford sociologists showed that the media heavily influences teenagers’ knowledge of contemporary affairs which has a highly positive impact on making them aware of the world. This awareness makes them global citizens and encourages them to share ideas.\r\n\r\nOn the contrary, many critics argue that teenagers would be negatively affected by the global media’s focus on negative issues of international events like wars and civil unrest if they are included in their education. This is because exposure to violence often leads to depression and the youths may grow an apathy towards our history and global politics.

To what extent do you agree or disagree?\n\nScore this IELTS Task 2 essay according to the rubric, ensuring alignment with the question:\n\nEducation plays a vital role in improving human well-being. There has been an inconclusive debate about whether the main objective of going to school is to transform students into workers, instead of offering  advantages to them individually, which I agree with this viewpoint. In this essay, the reasons supporting my idea will be presented in detail. \r\n\r\nFirst of all, most ordinary schools do not teach children about the necessary skill for living such as cooking, growing vegetables, raising animals, and constructing a house. They teach only the subjects that are important for studying in  higher education  and working in the companies, including Math, Science, and languages. Therefore, children cannot rely on themselves in order to produce their own food  and build their own house, Consequently, they need to work in the companies to put food on the table and need to collect money to buy a house. To illustrate the good education, Jone Jundai, a founder of homeschooling in Chiangmai, teaches his sons to cultivate various plants to consume, to raise chickens to collect eggs, as well as build earth houses, which pupils can have their own residence since young ages. \r\n\r\nFurthermore, the recent educational system solely focuses on the score and GPA. As a result, the students who are not fit with this particular system, and may have the talents for other issues such as dancing, singing, and drawing, are identified as stupid persons  and find it difficult to get jobs. For example, Jack Ma, a founder of Alibaba companies, the second richest person in China, was rejected from many prestigious universities as he could not pass the exams and the interviews. However, nowadays he is one of the most successful persons in the world by establishing the pioneering online shopping website in China. Thus, universities are not beneficial for some people.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, according to the information mentioned above, I strongly agree with the statement due to lack of basic skills for survival, and the curriculums focusing on scores are not suitable for all students who are different and unique.\n\nProvide your assessment in the specified JSON format."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"per_criterion\": [{\"name\": \"Task Response\", \"band\": 9.0, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"the main objective of going to school is to transform students into workers, instead of offering advantages to them individually\", \"most ordinary schools do not teach children about the necessary skill for living such as cooking, growing vegetables, raising animals, and constructing a house\", \"the recent educational system solely focuses on the score and GPA\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"which I agree with this viewpoint\", \"type\": \"clarity\", \"fix\": \"which I agree with\"}, {\"span\": \"the necessary skill for living\", \"type\": \"grammar\", \"fix\": \"the necessary skills for living\"}, {\"span\": \"identified as stupid persons\", \"type\": \"word choice\", \"fix\": \"identified as stupid\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Clarify your stance by rephrasing sentences for better coherence.\", \"Ensure subject-verb agreement and pluralization in your writing.\", \"Use more precise language to avoid negative connotations, such as replacing 'stupid persons' with 'students who struggle'.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Coherence & Cohesion\", \"band\": 8.0, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"the main objective of going to school is to transform students into workers, instead of offering advantages to them individually\", \"most ordinary schools do not teach children about the necessary skill for living such as cooking, growing vegetables, raising animals, and constructing a house\", \"the recent educational system solely focuses on the score and GPA\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"which I agree with this viewpoint\", \"type\": \"grammatical error\", \"fix\": \"which I agree with\"}, {\"span\": \"Consequently, they need to work in the companies to put food on the table and need to collect money to buy a house.\", \"type\": \"cohesion issue\", \"fix\": \"Consequently, they need to work in companies to put food on the table and collect money to buy a house.\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Ensure that all phrases are grammatically correct to enhance clarity.\", \"Use more varied linking words to improve the flow between sentences and paragraphs.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Lexical Resource\", \"band\": 8.0, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"Education plays a vital role in improving human well-being.\", \"the students who are not fit with this particular system, and may have the talents for other issues such as dancing, singing, and drawing, are identified as stupid persons\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"the necessary skill for living\", \"type\": \"word choice\", \"fix\": \"the necessary skills for living\"}, {\"span\": \"the curriculums focusing on scores\", \"type\": \"pluralization error\", \"fix\": \"the curricula focusing on scores\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Use a wider range of vocabulary to express ideas more precisely, such as replacing 'stupid persons' with 'individuals with different talents'.\", \"Ensure subject-verb agreement and correct pluralization in phrases like 'the necessary skills for living' and 'curricula'.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Grammatical Range & Accuracy\", \"band\": 9.0, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"Education plays a vital role in improving human well-being.\", \"the students who are not fit with this particular system, and may have the talents for other issues such as dancing, singing, and drawing, are identified as stupid persons\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"the necessary skill for living such as cooking\", \"type\": \"subject-verb agreement\", \"fix\": \"the necessary skills for living such as cooking\"}, {\"span\": \"the curriculums focusing on scores are not suitable\", \"type\": \"pluralization error\", \"fix\": \"the curricula focusing on scores are not suitable\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Ensure subject-verb agreement by using plural forms when necessary.\", \"Use the correct plural form of 'curriculum' to enhance accuracy.\"]}], \"overall\": 8.5}"}]}

In some countries, celebrities complain about the way the media publicizes their private lives. Some people say that they should accept it as part of their fame. Do you agree or disagree?\n\nScore this IELTS Task 2 essay according to the rubric, ensuring alignment with the question:\n\nIt is inevitable for prominent people to have a lot of attention from the public. Therefore, some famous individuals make a complaint to the media in order to have their boundaries. Some people insist that they have to admit this phenomenon as part of their fame. However, I strongly disagree with this opinion. This is because famous people have a right to have private space in their lives and they might be victims of criminals.\r\n\r\nTo begin with, eminent people have a right to have their own space in their daily lives. In fact, everyone needs a private room where they can be protected from external factors including famous people. Having a boundary plays a pivotal role in people's lives. When people's rights are invaded by other elements, they might be able to have mental issues such as depression, anxiety, and so on. To cite an example, some celebrities in South Korea struggle with their mental problems since they do not have enough space for their schedule. They protest to media companies to stop posting their life in order to tackle this problem. Sometimes, they have medicines or conduct sessions to deal with their stress. Moreover, This situation might lead their fandoms to have a sense of worry and a lot of entertainment companies to lose their assets as prominent people in our society.\r\n\r\nIn addition, celebrities might be able to become victims of awful people. The number of criminals has been increasing nowadays, some people, called a stoker, cross the private rooms. They are more likely to invade eminent people's daily lives by following their schedules every single day and taking a majority of pictures. Sometimes, they even attack celebrities physically. For example, there was a serious crime in China. One prominent actress, named Wan Wei was captured by a stoker. The criminal said that he was able to check her life by watching media news all the time. This means that too much information about celebrities' lives might cause detrimental situations for them such as stoking, captures, and so on.\r\n\r\nTo sum up, it is evident that some people reckon that they deserve to monitor celebrities' lives because of their fame. However, I totally disagree with it, since famous people have a right to have their boundaries and might be targeted by criminals.\n\nProvide your assessment in the specified JSON format."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"per_criterion\": [{\"name\": \"Task Response\", \"band\": 7.5, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"famous people have a right to have private space in their lives\", \"celebrities might be able to become victims of awful people\", \"famous people have a right to have their boundaries and might be targeted by criminals\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"some people, called a stoker, cross the private rooms\", \"type\": \"clarity\", \"fix\": \"replace 'stoker' with 'stalker' for correct terminology\"}, {\"span\": \"Having a boundary plays a pivotal role in people's lives\", \"type\": \"relevance\", \"fix\": \"clarify how this relates specifically to famous individuals\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Provide more specific examples of famous individuals and their experiences with privacy invasion to strengthen arguments.\", \"Clarify the connection between the need for privacy and the potential risks posed by criminals to enhance the overall argument.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Coherence & Cohesion\", \"band\": 6.5, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"famous people have a right to have private space in their lives\", \"Having a boundary plays a pivotal role in people's lives\", \"celebrities might be able to become victims of awful people\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"some people, called a stoker\", \"type\": \"inappropriate terminology\", \"fix\": \"replace 'stoker' with 'stalker'\"}, {\"span\": \"the number of criminals has been increasing nowadays, some people, called a stoker, cross the private rooms\", \"type\": \"run-on sentence\", \"fix\": \"split into two sentences for clarity\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Use clearer terminology to avoid confusion, such as replacing 'stoker' with 'stalker'.\", \"Ensure sentences are properly structured to avoid run-on sentences, which can disrupt the flow of ideas.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Lexical Resource\", \"band\": 6.5, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"Having a boundary plays a pivotal role in people's lives.\", \"celebrities might be able to become victims of awful people.\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"some people, called a stoker\", \"type\": \"word choice\", \"fix\": \"some people, called a stalker\"}, {\"span\": \"the number of criminals has been increasing nowadays\", \"type\": \"redundancy\", \"fix\": \"the number of criminals has been increasing\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Use more varied vocabulary to express similar ideas, such as synonyms for 'famous' or 'prominent'.\", \"Avoid redundancy by eliminating unnecessary words that do not add value to the sentence.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Grammatical Range & Accuracy\", \"band\": 7.5, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"Having a boundary plays a pivotal role in people's lives.\", \"The number of criminals has been increasing nowadays, some people, called a stoker, cross the private rooms.\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"some people, called a stoker, cross the private rooms.\", \"type\": \"punctuation error\", \"fix\": \"some people, called stalkers, cross into private rooms.\"}, {\"span\": \"Moreover, This situation might lead their fandoms to have a sense of worry and a lot of entertainment companies to lose their assets as prominent people in our society.\", \"type\": \"capitalization error\", \"fix\": \"Moreover, this situation might lead their fandoms to have a sense of worry and cause many entertainment companies to lose their assets as prominent people in our society.\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Ensure consistent use of terminology, such as using 'stalkers' instead of 'stokers.'\", \"Pay attention to capitalization rules, particularly at the beginning of sentences.\"]}], \"overall\": 7.0}"}]}

In my opinion, it is not something to be achieved but naturally found in humans. I will further explain this in detail.\r\n\r\nA group of people assume that leadership skill can be achieved through hard work and practice. There can be certain aspects involved in this judgement such as, there are many nations whose leaders failed to progress due to their incompetence and lack of responsibility. For example, it can be seen in elections that there are many candidates that are claiming to be good leaders but when it comes to performance it is rare to find one. Those people claimed to be good governer but when it comes to responsibility and showing strength, they lack in fulfilling it.

I believe that leadership is not a designation or a position, whereas, it is a responsibility. For instance, I have always observed in my early school that a student who is dominant and responsible  is appreciated by teachers. Moreover, teachers prefer to give them responsibilities for class-related things. Whereas, those students were small enough that they don't practice those skills but were naturally gifted. That is why I believe that  such skills are build-in inside a person but not practised.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, It is said by a few people that administration skills are gifted by nature, whereas, others assume that they can be achieved.

Personally, I believe that organizing such events has numerous beneficial impacts on a nation.\n\tAdvocates of the former view might assert that spending on sporting events could hurt countries’ economies. Running such international competitions as the World Cup or UEFA Euro can saddle the host countries with debts. This is because the breakdown of the sum of fees includes enhancing the infrastructure and capacity of their stadiums, implementing higher levels of security, and hiring performance artists for opening and closing ceremonies. For example, South Africa spent billions of dollars hosting the 2010 World Cup and then drowned in debt. Instead, those budgets should have been expended in improving the standard of living, eliminating starvation, and creating a better life for their people.\n\tHowever, I support the view that nations might reap more of the benefits of hosting those sporting events. Firstly, there are more job opportunities during years of planning and investment, thus contributing to a decrease in unemployment and building a prolific workforce. Secondly, those events could create enthusiasm and excitement for hosting nations’ people. It is clear from this encouragement that it will help to promote their emotional well-being.

One of the most important problems is air pollution as a result of using fusile fuel for transportation or industry.

Although authorities can reduce the amount of fuel and its impact, it does not properly work in long term. For instance, national law for increasing taxes on tobacco goods cannot help to solve the problem of using those products and I think that legislation on oil price does not work as well.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the authorities ought to apply alternative solutions for this situation. Firstly, public transportation should be increased and people encourage not only to use of public transportation like metro or taxi but also using bicycles and electrical scooters instead of their private car. Secondly, people should aware of the impact of increasing carbon emissions on the atmosphere. Thirdly, governments should investigate renewable energies for use on cars and other vehicles. For example, Tesla using electricity on their cars which is eco-friendly fuel. \r\n\r\nTo conclude, although forcing people to pay more money for petrol is the first step of consideration, it works for a while.

In addition, virtual classrooms and video conferencing have made it possible for students and teachers to connect and communicate without the need for a physical classroom. Furthermore, the use of artificial intelligence and machine learning has also impacted the way we learn. These technologies can personalize learning experiences for each individual, allowing students to work at their own pace and receive customized feedback. This has the potential to transform traditional teaching methods and create a more individualized approach to education.\r\n\r\nHowever, I do not believe that the typical teaching situation will completely disappear. While technology has its benefits, there are certain aspects of learning that require face-to-face interaction. The physical presence of a teacher in the classroom can be invaluable, as it provides students with the opportunity to ask questions, receive immediate feedback, and engage in group discussions. The classroom environment also promotes socialization and collaboration, which are essential skills for students to develop. Moreover, the traditional teaching situation provides a sense of structure and routine that can be beneficial for students. The physical classroom creates a learning space where students can focus and eliminate distractions. It also establishes a routine for students, which can help them develop good study habits and time management skills.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, while the teaching situation in the year 2050 may be different from what we know today, I believe that the traditional classroom setting will still exist to some extent. While technology may transform the way we learn, the physical presence of a teacher and the classroom environment provide benefits that cannot be replaced by digital tools.

In my view, effective educations in universities prepare you for a better future and getting professional qualifications.\r\n\r\nTo begin with, applying for prestigious establishments can assist citizens to achieve their ambitions and give them the best chances to improve their knowledge. Because  the universities have well-known professors that they have professional experience and can help people to become successful. For example, when people have gone to universities, they have developed their practical skills such as  communication skills, time management and leadership skills and these skills can influence  their future lives. In my opinion, going to top universities provide students with comprehensive educations that we cannot find  in any place. Consequently, becoming more successful in life can result in effective education in universities.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, getting experience or doing something you like can help you become professional rather than having academic degrees. Sometimes people pursue their ambitions or learn some skills that they want, and these goals can persuade them to become successful. For instance, C. Ronaldo is  one of the best soccer players in the world that does not have any academic degrees, and just he has endless effort. In my view, however, this statement can be accurate, the best way to become a successful person in your life is high-level education in universities.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, getting prestigious establishments is the best way that can assist people to become the professional people in their lives, whereas some others believe that  not more important as experiences and goals.

Only government action can solve this problem.\nTo what extent do you agree or disagree?\n\nScore this IELTS Task 2 essay according to the rubric, ensuring alignment with the question:\n\nHousing shortage in large metroplis can result in overcrowding, hygiene and even health problems. In order to deal with these issues, thorough and centralised government planning together with firm execution power is crucial. Thus, I firmly believe it is only through government led movements that alleviation of the problem could be realised.\n\nSome may propose that land developers and citizens have a role in aggravating the housing problems: developers can accelerate the process of building housing estates, while citizens can move to areas further away from city centre to reduce the congestion. Of course, these would rely on their conscience, which is often lacking. Who wouldn’t want to live in the proximity of their workplace or school, with all the shops and daily necessities in place? My friend, for instance, prefered to live in Sydney in a tiny flat as she felt it was extremely convenient, rather than go back to suburban areas which was remote and isolated. With the government’s policy in place, giving monetary incentives or welfare rewards to those who comply with increasing residential supply, the scheme would be much more efficient.\n\nHousing shortage in cosmopolitan cities can be attributed to two main factors: insufficient supply of residentials areas and rapid surge of population. The government, having the highest authority, has a pivotal role in regulating supply of houses to citizens. It is crystal clear that the government has the highest power to enact changes in society. They can design policies to ensure adequate supply of land is provided for residential use, as well as putting a limit to the population rise, therefore reaching a balance between man and space. Singapore is a glaring example, where the authorities have put together reasonably priced and spacious public housing estates for its citizens in the past decades, relieving the pressure on living space. Hong Kong, on the contrary, without such large scale public housing plans in place, finds itself constantly lacking in quality apartments to house the needy. \n\nTo conclude, housing problems could only be properly handle by the government. Without the officials led change, it is extremely difficult and inefficient to ease the pressure on housing supply.

Discuss both views and give your opinion.\n\nScore this IELTS Task 2 essay according to the rubric, ensuring alignment with the question:\n\nThere is a tremendously controversial prospective heating up a debate the origin of the leadership. While some people hold a strong view that it is a natural skill, the opposites make a statement that a person can become a leader through the experience as well as the knowledge. This essay will discuss both point of view and my personal opinion about this phenomenon\r\n\r\nEvidently, a wealth of people are naturally born leaders since they own the strong characteristics to become a leader such as being outgoing person, gregarious and full of energy. All these personality traits help the leader to manage, to gather people together and to inspire and motivate them. Vladimir Putin, a president of Russia can be cited as an outstanding example that he natural born political leader who inspires many people with his boundless professional abilities, charisma and display astounding skills. Hence, being sociable, charisma and having strong traits are important natural skills for being a chief.\r\n\r\nAlthough the leadership skill is one of natural skills, I still belive that it can be built and enhanced.  There are a bunch of elements that make someone a great leader, such as discipline and resourcefulness, which can definitely be developed through one's upbringing and life period. For instance, to become a pioneer as well as a president of Vietnam, Hochiminh had to spent three decades in this life on travelling around the world and  acquire the knowledge from developed nations in this time to find an ideal way to lead our country. Therefore, beside a natural skill, leadership can be developed by the experience in life. \r\n\r\nIn conclusion, although a strong leader's talents and traits are both genetic and can be improved by training, observation, and a lot of hard work, there are many people born without natural leadership skills who can still become good leaders thank to their attemption.\n\nProvide your assessment in the specified JSON format."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"per_criterion\": [{\"name\": \"Task Response\", \"band\": 6.0, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"This essay will discuss both point of view and my personal opinion about this phenomenon\", \"there are many people born without natural leadership skills who can still become good leaders thank to their attemption.\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"point of view\", \"type\": \"clarity\", \"fix\": \"point of views\"}, {\"span\": \"belive\", \"type\": \"spelling\", \"fix\": \"believe\"}, {\"span\": \"thank to their attemption\", \"type\": \"clarity\", \"fix\": \"thanks to their attention\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Clarify the thesis statement to explicitly outline the main arguments that will be discussed in the essay.\", \"Ensure that the conclusion summarizes the key points made in the body paragraphs more effectively.\", \"Use more precise language and correct spelling to enhance clarity and professionalism.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Coherence & Cohesion\", \"band\": 5.0, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"This essay will discuss both point of view and my personal opinion about this phenomenon\", \"Therefore, beside a natural skill, leadership can be developed by the experience in life.\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"both point of view\", \"type\": \"grammatical error\", \"fix\": \"both points of view\"}, {\"span\": \"thank to their attemption\", \"type\": \"word choice error\", \"fix\": \"thanks to their attention\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Use clearer topic sentences to guide the reader through each paragraph's main idea.\", \"Ensure that transitions between ideas are smooth to enhance the flow of the essay.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Lexical Resource\", \"band\": 5.0, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"a wealth of people are naturally born leaders\", \"being sociable, charisma and having strong traits are important natural skills for being a chief\", \"there are many people born without natural leadership skills who can still become good leaders\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"the origin of the leadership\", \"type\": \"word choice\", \"fix\": \"the origin of leadership\"}, {\"span\": \"the opposites make a statement\", \"type\": \"word choice\", \"fix\": \"the opposing view states\"}, {\"span\": \"belive\", \"type\": \"spelling\", \"fix\": \"believe\"}, {\"span\": \"beside a natural skill\", \"type\": \"word choice\", \"fix\": \"besides natural skills\"}, {\"span\": \"thank to their attemption\", \"type\": \"word choice\", \"fix\": \"thanks to their attention\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Use more precise vocabulary to convey ideas clearly and accurately.\", \"Pay attention to spelling and grammatical errors to enhance overall clarity.\", \"Vary sentence structures to improve the richness of the essay.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Grammatical Range & Accuracy\", \"band\": 6.0, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"there are many people born without natural leadership skills who can still become good leaders thank to their attemption.\", \"I still belive that it can be built and enhanced.\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"the origin of the leadership\", \"type\": \"article usage\", \"fix\": \"the origin of leadership\"}, {\"span\": \"belive\", \"type\": \"spelling error\", \"fix\": \"believe\"}, {\"span\": \"thank to their attemption\", \"type\": \"incorrect phrase\", \"fix\": \"thanks to their attention\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Review the use of articles to ensure correct usage, such as omitting 'the' before 'leadership.'\", \"Proofread for spelling errors, particularly common words like 'believe.'\", \"Use the correct phrase 'thanks to' instead of 'thank to' for clarity and accuracy.\"]}], \"overall\": 5.5}"}]}

Moreover, they think there are more vital and immediate issues that need more attention and investment than nature catastrophies, since they have not seen any servere effects yet.

There is an argument that doing sports in a team is the best way for children to acquire that at school and I mostly agree with this idea.\r\n\r\nOn the one hand, it seems to me that there are also other ways for children to learn teamwork other than team sports. They can get tasks such as cleaning their class as a team or playing some games. For example, grouping students by their teacher and playing pantomime is a way to learn that thinking together is more beneficial. Another way is taking a group examination. In this way, each student should answer just one question but everyone will get the same score. Therefore, all of them will be panelised if even one pupil cannot answer correctly. Consequently, they will all study together for the next exam.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, I almost agree that learning cooperation through team sports may be the best way for children. They will find out that the smallest disharmony would result in losing the game.

Do you think the positive effects outweigh the negative effects?\n\nScore this IELTS Task 2 essay according to the rubric, ensuring alignment with the question:\n\nIn our rapidly changing world, an increasing number of tasks that were traditionally performed by humans are now being handled by machines. This shift raises questions  about whether the advantages of this development outweigh the disadvantages. In my opinion, however, despite there are few drawbacks, the benefits of machines taking over human tasks are indeed far more.\r\n\r\nThe advantages of machines performing human tasks are multifaceted.  Firstly, automation signifactly enhances productivity and efficiency. Machines can operate without fatigue,maintain consistent precision, and complete tasks at much more faster rate than humans. This is evident in manufacturing, where automated assembly lines have revolutionized production, reducing human errors, increasing output, and improving product quality.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, machines excel in handling dangerous and monotonous tasks, thereby reducing human exposure to hazardous environments. For instance, robots are widely employed in bomb disposal and in exploring extreme conditions, such as space and deep-sea exploration. This not only safeguards human lives but also facilitates the collection of valuable data.\r\n\r\nNonetheless, the transition towards automation is not without challenges, including potential job displacement and the dehumanization of work. As machines become more capable and efficient, certain jobs become obsolete, leading to unemployment and necessitating the acquisition of new skills.

Others think that there are more important issues. \r\n\r\nDiscuss both views and give your opinion\n\nScore this IELTS Task 2 essay according to the rubric, ensuring alignment with the question:\n\nIt is undeniable that scientific research has become an important aspect to solve the world’s issues. While some people argue that research on science should be conducted mainly on global health issues, others believe that other problems are also significant. Both perspectives would be explained in this essay. \r\n\r\nOn the one hand, global health problems have become more rampant throughout the years, especially with the unpredictable rapid appearance of viruses among nations like COVID-19. Thus, commencing scientific studies might redeem the number of patients. For instance, in 2020, the government was able to tackle the spread of COVID-19 and prevent the spike of sufferers due to a dazzling commitment to support research involving the invention of coronavirus vaccines. As a result, tourist attractions, offices, and industries are allowed to be run without tight restrictions and the world begins to revitalize. Therefore, it is of importance to dedicate scientific research on international health to counteract and resolve upcoming worldwide diseases. \r\n\r\nOn the contrary, other subjects could not be overlooked. Studies on agriculture contribute to public well-being as its studies assist farmers to develop well-bred crops which could make it easier for developing countries to harvest high nutrition yields with limited farming equipment. For instance, in Kenya, scientists developed ways to grow plants in infertile soil during a dry season. Because of this, the lack of food in developing nations is scarce and inventions in agriculture solve the world’s hunger.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nIn my opinion, although both arguments are valid, global health should be prioritized and thus, scientific investigations should become the focus. However, studies on other fields might be conducted as long as their proportion is worth less than research on worldwide health problems.\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nIn conclusion, manifesting an observation on other fields might be beneficial to solve the world hunger yet public health ought to be the major attention to tackle some of the deadly viruses like coronavirus, variola, or Ebola.\n\nProvide your assessment in the specified JSON format."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"per_criterion\": [{\"name\": \"Task Response\", \"band\": 8.0, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"scientific research has become an important aspect to solve the world’s issues\", \"global health should be prioritized and thus, scientific investigations should become the focus\", \"public health ought to be the major attention to tackle some of the deadly viruses like coronavirus, variola, or Ebola\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"the lack of food in developing nations is scarce\", \"type\": \"clarity\", \"fix\": \"rephrase to 'the lack of food in developing nations is significant'\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Provide more specific examples of how scientific research has directly impacted global health and agriculture.\", \"Clarify the argument about the importance of other subjects by providing more detailed examples or data.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Coherence & Cohesion\", \"band\": 7.0, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"Both perspectives would be explained in this essay.\", \"Therefore, it is of importance to dedicate scientific research on international health to counteract and resolve upcoming worldwide diseases.\", \"In conclusion, manifesting an observation on other fields might be beneficial to solve the world hunger yet public health ought to be the major attention to tackle some of the deadly viruses like coronavirus, variola, or Ebola.\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"the lack of food in developing nations is scarce\", \"type\": \"incoherence\", \"fix\": \"Revise to 'the lack of food in developing nations is significant' to avoid contradictory phrasing.\"}, {\"span\": \"as long as their proportion is worth less than research on worldwide health problems\", \"type\": \"cohesion\", \"fix\": \"Clarify the phrase to 'as long as their proportion is less significant than that of research on worldwide health problems' for better clarity.\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Use clearer transitions between paragraphs to enhance the flow of ideas.\", \"Ensure that all statements are logically consistent and avoid contradictions in phrasing.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Lexical Resource\", \"band\": 7.0, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"scientific research has become an important aspect to solve the world’s issues\", \"the unpredictable rapid appearance of viruses among nations like COVID-19\", \"manifesting an observation on other fields might be beneficial to solve the world hunger\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"the lack of food in developing nations is scarce\", \"type\": \"word choice\", \"fix\": \"the lack of food in developing nations is prevalent\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Use a wider range of synonyms to avoid repetition, such as using 'issues' instead of 'problems' or 'challenges'.\", \"Incorporate more advanced vocabulary to enhance the sophistication of the essay, such as 'mitigate' instead of 'solve' or 'address'.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Grammatical Range & Accuracy\", \"band\": 8.0, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"scientific research has become an important aspect to solve the world’s issues\", \"the government was able to tackle the spread of COVID-19 and prevent the spike of sufferers due to a dazzling commitment to support research involving the invention of coronavirus vaccines\", \"studies on agriculture contribute to public well-being as its studies assist farmers to develop well-bred crops\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"the lack of food in developing nations is scarce\", \"type\": \"word choice\", \"fix\": \"the lack of food in developing nations is significant\"}, {\"span\": \"their proportion is worth less than research on worldwide health problems\", \"type\": \"awkward phrasing\", \"fix\": \"their proportion is less than that of research on worldwide health problems\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Use more varied sentence structures to enhance the complexity of the writing.\", \"Ensure precise word choices to avoid contradictions and improve clarity.\"]}], \"overall\": 7.5}"}]}

Some people think art is essential for students and the country, while others oppose this viewpoint. This essay will discuss both views and give a relevant opinion on them.\r\n\r\nTo begin with, art is an essential subject for students in terms of positive development. Students learn about their country's history, culture, and traditions. For example, a country like India has diverse cultures and traditions it is important for the citizen to have knowledge of their country when they move to different parts that will help to a certain extent. Moreover, art is good for mental health, as subjects like math and science are very frustrating and stressful, whereas art helps to relax the mind and Borden the thinking process. Hence, art has an essential place in schools\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, some people deny this idea of teaching art subjects in schools. First and foremost, taking subjects like math, science and computer provide a better opportunity in their career. For example, artists like painters and singers can hardly manage daily expenses, whereas doctors, managers, and IT professionals get enough to save for the future. In addition, those who graduate from engineering, business, and medical science make more contributions in terms of the country's economic development like improving infrastructure, increasing life expectancy, and increasing country's revenue with better management. \r\n\r\nIn Conclusion, although art is very helpful for students to rejuvenate their minds, get off from a hectic schedule, and learn about their country's history and traditions, science and business subjects help the countries grow more. In my opinion, art and science hold special positions.

This opinion might be the case for some manual duty tasks. However, it is improbable that jobs that require creativity and human interaction will be taken over by computers.T essay will discuss the reasons why ultimately, there are some operations that yet still need a human touch, and cannot be replaced by self-moving machines.\r\n\r\nMachines, one day may assume the hard labour that does not demand complex human skills. With the ever-fast-moving economy, compared to hiring and employing a human, industries need the consistencies that a well-tailored program offer by doing the tasks more flawlessly and more efficiently, thus removing the man-error factor on the day-to-day operational field. We can see in the real world nowadays, huge companies such as Amazon are employing engines to handle some of the work in their factories. Not only that, the machines can work 24/7, and they are cost-efficient, in the sense that they require no holiday pay and another form of extra allowance. Ergo, it is safe to assume that in the future, self-regulating machines can take over some of the hard labour professions that  are currently being done by humans.\r\n\r\nOn the contrary, there are some works that, in my opinion, automation will never be able to replicate. Careers in the creativity and artistry sectors require human experience, emotions, and feelings that science and engineering cannot reproduce. For instance, to be a musician, visual artist, poet, or book writer, one needs to have a sense of individuality, self-expression and uniqueness that computers do not have. Robots will never be able to understand and achieve the sense of artistry and beauty that person is capable of doing.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, there is a significant number of lines of work that may be replaced and conducted by computers in the future. Artificial intelligence will take over the manual and unskilled labour market. Despite that, jobs that need a specific form of skills and expertise are here to stay.

Space science has been the most popular and expensive field. However, there is a debate regarding the spending amount of money since people believe that this money can use in other fields which give more benefit to humanity. I completely disagree with this opinion.\n\nTo begin with, exploration  out of the world is significant for human’s future since World Space Agency (WSA) research shows that resources of the earth start to decrease because of some situations such as overpopulation or excess use of the car. In addition, another survey which is also done by WSA in 2020 published that people will suffer from a lack of clean water next few decades. For this reason, scientists begin to search for another planet like our world to maintain human life in the future. Therefore, the cost of these is obviously high, and saving the next life should be the most beneficial way for the investment. \n\nSecondly, recently earth has been the only known planet for life since humans have not  totally explored the other part of the universe. In other words, there may be some intelligent creatures in some parts of the space. Anyone does not know  whether they will threaten people’s life or not. In addition, some natural planet disasters can occur such as meteor crashes, and thanks to research, undesirable results may be avoided. As a result, humans should spend more money on space fields to protect themselves from unknowns.\n\nTo conclude, Although there are different notions on space exploration investments, I think that these are crucial for humanity, and even more money should spend on this area.\n\nProvide your assessment in the specified JSON format."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"per_criterion\": [{\"name\": \"Task Response\", \"band\": 8.0, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"exploration out of the world is significant for human’s future\", \"the cost of these is obviously high, and saving the next life should be the most beneficial way for the investment\", \"I think that these are crucial for humanity, and even more money should spend on this area\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"this money can use in other fields\", \"type\": \"clarity\", \"fix\": \"this money can be used in other fields\"}, {\"span\": \"next few decades\", \"type\": \"grammatical error\", \"fix\": \"in the next few decades\"}, {\"span\": \"anyone does not know\", \"type\": \"clarity\", \"fix\": \"no one knows\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Clarify the argument by providing specific examples of how space exploration benefits humanity.\", \"Ensure grammatical accuracy by reviewing verb forms and prepositions.\", \"Strengthen the conclusion by summarizing key points made in the essay.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Coherence & Cohesion\", \"band\": 7.0, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"exploration out of the world is significant for human’s future\", \"the cost of these is obviously high, and saving the next life should be the most beneficial way for the investment\", \"these are crucial for humanity, and even more money should spend on this area\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"next few decades\", \"type\": \"grammatical error\", \"fix\": \"next few decades should be 'in the next few decades'\"}, {\"span\": \"anyone does not know\", \"type\": \"word order error\", \"fix\": \"it is not known whether\"}, {\"span\": \"even more money should spend on this area\", \"type\": \"grammatical error\", \"fix\": \"even more money should be spent on this area\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Use linking words and phrases to better connect ideas between sentences and paragraphs.\", \"Ensure grammatical structures are correct to enhance clarity and coherence.\", \"Consider rephrasing sentences for smoother flow and to avoid awkward constructions.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Lexical Resource\", \"band\": 7.0, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"enormous investments in the technology industry\", \"exploration out of the world is significant for human’s future\", \"humans should spend more money on space fields to protect themselves from unknowns\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"this money can use in other fields\", \"type\": \"word form\", \"fix\": \"this money can be used in other fields\"}, {\"span\": \"the cost of these is obviously high\", \"type\": \"word choice\", \"fix\": \"the cost of this is obviously high\"}, {\"span\": \"next few decades\", \"type\": \"missing article\", \"fix\": \"the next few decades\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Use more varied vocabulary to avoid repetition, such as synonyms for 'money' and 'investments'.\", \"Ensure grammatical accuracy by using correct verb forms and articles.\", \"Incorporate more complex sentence structures to enhance the sophistication of the writing.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Grammatical Range & Accuracy\", \"band\": 8.0, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"exploration out of the world is significant for human’s future\", \"the cost of these is obviously high, and saving the next life should be the most beneficial way for the investment\", \"humans should spend more money on space fields to protect themselves from unknowns\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"this money can use in other fields\", \"type\": \"verb form\", \"fix\": \"this money can be used in other fields\"}, {\"span\": \"next few decades\", \"type\": \"missing article\", \"fix\": \"the next few decades\"}, {\"span\": \"these are crucial for humanity, and even more money should spend on this area\", \"type\": \"verb form\", \"fix\": \"even more money should be spent on this area\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Ensure correct verb forms are used, especially in passive constructions.\", \"Pay attention to the use of articles, particularly with plural and singular nouns.\", \"Vary sentence structures to enhance the overall grammatical range.\"]}], \"overall\": 7.5}"}]}

In my opinion, we should focus on these problems with our governments but also we need to realize what we are doing about environmental pollution problems. \r\n\r\nAlmost all governments around the World are trying to find better solutions for environmental pollution and housing problems. This is the correct way to prevent illness and disease. Furthermore, at the same time goverments  are avoiding implementation of solved  problems. The best example of this is The Kyoto protocol. There are so many solved problems about environmental pollution in the protocol. But some countries do not implement it even though they accepted it, also some countries have given up protocol. Every government needs protocols like the Kyoto Protocol to solve environmental pollution problems. Moreover, the governments should support the building of liveable houses rather than government buildings. In poor countries, like my own country,  huge government buildings have been built and they are not necessary. Governments should realize that the quality of life is much more important than other problems. People will have a better chance to decrease illness and disease if they solve pollution and housing issues.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, people should realize that the quality of their lives is dependent on themselves. If people want a better quality house, they should demand more from their local authorities. For example, people may question how their taxes are spent and they may want different resources such as long term loans for house problems. Also, If people want a higher quality of life, they should keep going to develop their own solution for environmental problems. These solutions may be small but the impact will be huge. For example, recycle, using public transport, respect to nature, walking for short distances. These help to become healthy and also make the environment better.

This essay will agree with the given idea of misguiding young people since it can convey false hopes to teenagers and increasingly enable the celebrities’ industry with spoiled influencers.\n\nTo begin with, endorsing charm and wealth rather than achievements allows people to misinterpret the actual way to become a celebrity. This means that people with decent background and attractive physique can effortlessly be a famous person, consequently making other individuals to think that they may never become a celebrity without those supports.On the other hand, teenagers with their original assets are likely to assume being a public figure will not take a considerable effort. This will definitely make them desperate when they encounter the real situation in life.\n\nAnother reason could be the establishment of fake societies of celebrities. When adolescents are tempted to become a celebrity in a way that neglects hard work and advocates outer contributions and if they somehow become such people, this will potentially impact the overall authenticity of film industries. Hence, they may promote further inauthentic societies of famous people by broadcasting movies that emphasize attractiveness and wealth. Additionally, research shows that people tend to imitate what they see, ultimately contributing to encourage more corrupted influencers.\n\nIn conclusion, although glamour and wealth are arguably the assets of a celebrity, I do not agree that they are choosing them over achievements as it can make young people misunderstand and form a superficial community of influencers.

The first prominent factor is a desire to love the temperature. To be more precise, it is seen that during the summer period the public avoid outing while during cold temperature societies not only to tend go on holiday trip but also arrange numerous events. For example, In India, a number of weddings happen during  cold seasons to enjoy the moments that are not possible in the hot period. Moreover, in winter time people amuse themselves with the bonfire which has its own value. In other words, the spring period also provides a lot of happiness in terms of crops and festivals that, a number of communities celebrate as agricultural events. Therefore, based on the above lines it can be said that temperature affects people's lifestyles.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the economy can be directly related to climate in numerous regions. To be more comprehensive,  some  regions depend on the tourist who travels to these areas merely to enjoy the weather as these states' income relies on tourism. For instance, In India, a majority of the population goes to Shimla merely to experience the snow tourists make advance bookings months prior. If due to global warming there is no snowfall in winter times then no one will travel to these areas as result there will no revenue that will hamper their income.

Some people think that children going to single-sex schools have disadvantages later in life. To what extent do you agree?\n\nScore this IELTS Task 2 essay according to the rubric, ensuring alignment with the question:\n\nA society is made up of both men and women and schools act as building blocks of any civilised community. Often what we learn at school consciously or subconsciously goes with us a long way . In many countries , parents have the choice to send their kids to same-sex schools or co-educational schools.I totally agree that children going to single-gender schools have disadvantages later in life. Analysing the behaviour patterns and awkwardness developed towards other sex due to the atmosphere in such institutes and the gender bias imbibed by not maintaining a balanced society will help advocate this.\r\n\r\nFirstly , students who spend most of their time with the same sex might develop  awkward behaviour when interacting with the other gender . For example , it's not a hidden fact that most of the meaningful friendships are formed during school time therefore kids in same-sex schools tend to share their thoughts and feelings only with one gender ,  with time it becomes difficult for them to open up with the other sex. Hence , same-sex schools create a communication barrier and behavioural eccentricity in them.\r\n\r\nSecondly , since such kids become more accustomed to one gender and tend to align and share their thoughts with only them hence a feeling of gender bias arises in them. For instance , it might be difficult for females in all-girls schools to accept that males have the same spectrum of emotions as them and further tend to refrain themselves from indulging with other sex. Similarly for boys, it might be a complex thought that girls can also be physically as strong as guys hence a sense of bias might develop . Thus , the same-sex school also adds the disadvantage of a gender bias in  society.\r\n\r\nIn the nutshell , same-gender schools have many disadvantages and it is correct to say that these disadvantages are added later in a child's life when they have to face the real world. The world needs a balanced and perfect amalgamation of experiences and perspectives of both the sex .

Although some hold an opinion that it can be worthless and unnecessary to add art subjects in a curriculum, I believe art has direct relativity with one's creativity which can bring a plethora of advantages for the overall growth.\r\n\r\nOpponents of an art subject whilst school days have firm viewpoints that it does not bring success in career and every effort invested to get into those are waste. This is because many artists struggle to match their living needs. For instance, if a painter may have difficulties in selling his drawn painting, it eventually leads to struggle for a stable life due to lack of money. In contrast, a time utilized for learning active subjects like maths, science, accounts, and many more may come to rescue as they lead to high paying stable jobs like engineers, doctors, or chartered accountants.\r\n\r\nOn the other side of the spectrum, knowledge in art subjects from early age brings myriads of benefits for overall development.

Some emphasize the significance of good planning, whereas others attribute success to other factors such as hard work and luck. In this essay, both sides will be explored, followed by my opinion.\r\n\r\nOn the one hand, it is of the opinion that good planning is a key contributor to a person's success. It ensures that people can achieve their goals. This is because they plan out detailed steps to follow to reach every single target and then create the whole picture of the procedure. A detailed plan enables individuals to predict foreseeable scenarios and make timely adjustments in the future. In other words, this perspective highlight the importance of organizing, foresight and discipline execution to achive one's objectives.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, others contend that success in life can be primarily driven by hard work. They believe that hard work encompasses several factors, including discipline, determination, resilience and the willingness to invest time and efforts into pursuing one's inspiration. This perspective highlight the belief that success can be the result of continuous efforts and a strong work ethic. In addition, some attribute success to other factors like luck or favourable circumstances. They argue that external elements beyond an individual's control can significantly impact their opportunities and outcomes. Luck can be manifested in the form of fortuitous encounters, favourable timing and unexpected events that open a door to success. This viewpoint recognizes that aspects outside good planning and hard work can also play a crucial role in achieving one's accomplishment.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, one's success in life can be influenced by several factors. Good planning provides a road map, hard work drives discipline and luck or favourable circumstances create opportunities.

Labours had to carry heavy loads at construction work. Automated machines that carry heavy weights had made such work easy. Further, housewives used to wash clothes by their hands but now they can easily wash these in washing-machines.

I agree to some extent with this notion. The subsequent essay will highlight not only arguments in favouring but also some opposite prospects of it. \r\n\r\n To begin with, Innumerable aspects are attached to how other reasons rather than money improve work performance in the working area. First of all, If the working environment is not only friendly, but also has appropriate cooperation and coordination among colleagues, the efforts required to achieve any task could be minimized. Completion of a particular target under a definite deadline, therefore, could be ensured. Furthermore, When the working pressure is less, it causes a reduction of stress level which enables workers to perform appropriately. In addition, Job security which brings financial stability is also beneficial to carry out actions effectively. Moreover, Leaves offer an opportunity for the employees to accomplish their personal jobs or spend time with family members. Perseverance towards their profession, thus, could be strengthened. For instance, maternity leaves offered by many organizations to the mother during pregnancy time encourage their attraction towards their occupation.  Also, other amenities such as medical and commuting facility also the predominant motivating factors in the work area. \r\n\r\nDespite having many pivotal factors, money has also a vital role. Since a handsome salary is indispensable to fulfil their own and family desires. It leads to a strong family relationship and, provides sufficient funds that could be spent in an emergency. As a consequence, money fascinates the workers towards their vocation.  \r\n\r\nIn conclusion, I reiterate that although money is a colossal factor for improving work efficiency on the job, other lucrative factors are also advantageous to prompt employees for their assigned actions at work.\n\nProvide your assessment in the specified JSON format."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"per_criterion\": [{\"name\": \"Coherence & Cohesion\", \"band\": 6.5, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"the subsequent essay will highlight not only arguments in favouring but also some opposite prospects of it.\", \"If the working environment is not only friendly, but also has appropriate cooperation and coordination among colleagues, the efforts required to achieve any task could be minimized.\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"arguments in favouring\", \"type\": \"word choice\", \"fix\": \"arguments in favor\"}, {\"span\": \"also the predominant motivating factors in the work area.\", \"type\": \"sentence structure\", \"fix\": \"also are predominant motivating factors in the work area.\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Use more varied linking words and phrases to improve the flow between ideas.\", \"Ensure subject-verb agreement and correct verb forms throughout the essay.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Task Response\", \"band\": 7.5, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"I agree to some extent with this notion.\", \"the efforts required to achieve any task could be minimized.\", \"money has also a vital role.\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"arguments in favouring\", \"type\": \"word choice\", \"fix\": \"arguments in favor\"}, {\"span\": \"Innumerable aspects are attached to how other reasons rather than money improve work performance in the working area.\", \"type\": \"clarity\", \"fix\": \"Innumerable aspects show how reasons other than money improve work performance.\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Clarify the introduction by explicitly stating the main points that will be discussed in the essay.\", \"Ensure consistent use of terminology, such as replacing 'favouring' with 'favor' for clarity and correctness.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Lexical Resource\", \"band\": 6.5, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"money is considered to be a paramount reason\", \"the efforts required to achieve any task could be minimized\", \"money fascinates the workers towards their vocation\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"Innumerable aspects are attached to how other reasons rather than money improve work performance in the working area\", \"type\": \"word choice\", \"fix\": \"Consider rephrasing to 'Numerous aspects are related to how factors other than money enhance work performance in the workplace.'\"}, {\"span\": \"the predominant motivating factors in the work area\", \"type\": \"repetition\", \"fix\": \"Replace 'in the work area' with 'in the workplace' to avoid redundancy.\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Use a wider range of vocabulary to express similar ideas, avoiding repetition.\", \"Consider using more precise terms to enhance clarity and avoid ambiguity.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Grammatical Range & Accuracy\", \"band\": 6.5, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"the efforts required to achieve any task could be minimized.\", \"money fascinates the workers towards their vocation.\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"Innumerable aspects are attached to how other reasons rather than money improve work performance in the working area.\", \"type\": \"subject-verb agreement\", \"fix\": \"Innumerable aspects are attached to how reasons other than money improve work performance in the workplace.\"}, {\"span\": \"also the predominant motivating factors in the work area.\", \"type\": \"missing verb\", \"fix\": \"are also predominant motivating factors in the workplace.\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Vary sentence structures to enhance grammatical range, such as using more complex sentences.\", \"Ensure subject-verb agreement and correct preposition usage to improve accuracy.\"]}], \"overall\": 7.0}"}]}

Secondly, the financial and business sections of newspapers may carry important information on economic matters which influence the lives of everyone.

Many folks believe that only the government  is able to solve this problem. However, from the way I am thinking, I do not agree with this idea.\n\nOn the one hand, it is undeniable that one of many government responsibilities is to ensure that the residents have houses to live in. I am convinced that all the councils in the world, regardless of the region where the cities are based. I remember a friend of mine once said that in his home country, the executive prepared and constructed buildings to accommodate the citizens. I was blown away when I heard this and imagined if the government in my homeland do the same thing. However, I realize that there are other, arguably more emerging, issues that are faced by the government, that need to be solved first. So waiting for the government to singlehandedly solve the housing issue is not a wise move we can do as a resident, especially if we are not from the richest country on this planet.\n\nOn top of the government, I strongly believe that other players also play the same key role in this issue, the private sector for instance. They can contribute to tackling the issue in their own ways. Whereas banks can help its customer  get a friendly loan to buy a house, property companies could provide an easy scheme to pay for the houses. Those are only two of many examples of how private sectors are able to help.

However, some people believe that free education for at least six years for every kid are necessarily needed  so that all children can learn how to read, write, and count numbers. I strongly agree with this opinion, and in this essay, I will elaborate my reasons. \r\n\r\nTo begin with, education is one of the keys to the advancement of the country. This could be one of the reasons why elementary school, which is the first sixth stage of learning is essential and should be paid for at zero cost. After 6 years, all the children will obtain knowledge, skills, and understanding that necessary to success in this life, especially in the future . Moreover, there are probably some scholarships that they will get to continue their education, and can be the other way for them to become a successor of their nation. For example, The Ministry of Education Republic of Indonesia has a policy to make all the public schools in Jakarta, which is the capital city of Indonesia,  free. As a result, 70% of kids who graduate from public school have good trackers, some of them take the next journey to  university, and the rest of them are accepted by companies to work.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, this idea of free education can be the motivation for other children as well. For instance, a survey conducted by The Nation of Children Indonesia said that 50% of children who were previously not enrolled in school reveal the reason why they want to study in the education institution is that they look at their friend who went to school every day, it motivates them and they curious about the feeling to become a student. This is totally a good movement, if there are a lot of children who want to school, the hope rate of the nation to get better in development is high.\r\n\r\nTo sum up, not paying for the tuition fees

That is caused for two main reasons that I am going to explain in this essay and also give some solutions.\r\n\r\nFirstly, the main reason for this situation is the rising population living in the world. Every day the amount of earth's population is dramatically growing, especially, with the constant evolution in the field of medicine. Because of that people's life expectancy is rising and there is always a need for new houses and roads to be built, since more and more people are using cars to move around. \r\n\r\nMoreover, with economic development someone could be more easily able to afford a car, which may be more convenient for them to get to their work instead of using a bus. \r\n\r\nTo solve this problem the governments should promote and develop more public transportation, since in that way more people can avoid using the roads in their own vehicles. For example, the underground and overground trains are a very sufficient way to complete many crowd's needs to move around instead of taking a bus or a car. Furthermore, the trains have their own railways and during their stops they don't interfere with the street.\r\n\r\nIn addition, one other action is to upgrade the existing roads so that more means of transport can be used in the same driveway.

Why? Do advantages of this outweigh disadvantages?\n\nScore this IELTS Task 2 essay according to the rubric, ensuring alignment with the question:\n\nNowadays, more and more couples have a plan to give birth in their older age than in the previous generations. This happens because of some certain reasons and I believe that this trend brings more drawbacks than benefits.\nThere are some causes that contribute to the decision of having children in old age of parents. The first reason is related to freedom. Bringing up a child would take a large amount of time of married couples, this results in the lack of free time for themselves to do what they like. For example, those who have a hobby of travelling will feel comfortable and carefree when taking trips to their favorite destinations without worrying about taking after of a child. Another reason is that high cost of living. The increase in prices of goods make parents find more difficult to raise a child nowadays than in the past, therefore they want to have an abundant source of finance before giving birth by spending most of their time in their young age to work and having children in their old age. \nOn the one hand, having children late will affect negatively to mothers’ health and babies’ as well. Giving birth at an old age results in disorders and innate malformations in newborn babies and even take mothers’ life. Another disadvantage is the negative effect to the economic development. This is because the growth of old population leads to the shortage of young labor workforce. Thus, the economy has to rely on mainly older workers, from that economic performance and productivity are low. On the other hand, delivering a baby in the old age also bring advantages. Parents have more time to work and earn money in their young age, hence they can secure a better life for their children in the future.

While it is widely believed that it is parents who teach children to recycle waste schools are more responsible, others believe. In my opinion, it is parents who teach children to recycle waste.\r\n\r\nOn the one hand, it is argued by some it is parents who teach children to recycle waste. The main reason is that they believe that parents are people, whom the children  spent most time with them, therefore they should be the person who teach children about recycling waste to protect environment and protect our life It is also possible to say that family have to be in charge of educating younger generation protect environment. According a science research, the scientist show that between the family teaching is always more memorable with the children than another teaching just because the parents are the most credible person with them. \r\n\r\nOn the other hand, it is strongly believed by others that schools are more responsible in teaching youngers recycle the waste. People often have this opinion because they alway think teachers were trained and paid for educating children and parents aren’t. A second point is that today, the parents ‘s job seem is making them too busy and they haven’t enough time to teach children to recycle waste so teachers and school have to be who have more responsible. A particularly good example here is my uncle is ready to pay a large mount of money to give his children to a boarding school because he really isn’t have enough time to teach his kids and he hope that they will have a good education in that school and will be taken care carefully, that he can’t give his children. \r\n\r\nIn conclusion, nowadays some parents believe that it is they who teach

To what extent do you agree or disagree?\n\nScore this IELTS Task 2 essay according to the rubric, ensuring alignment with the question:\n\nNowadays, it is true that some celebrities are known for their glamorous lifestyles rather than for their contribution to society. Some argue that this phenomenon has an adverse effect on the youth. I partly agree with that view.\n\nOn the one hand, famous people somehow have influences on the community, especially their followers. At puberty age, the personality and behaviour of teenagers could be affected by many factors, including their idols whom they consider as role models. Take obsessive fans as an example. When they looking at the exotic and lavish lifestyle of their idols, they try to imitate and possess similar objects, despite the financial issues. This exerts materialistic lifestyles, which has potential negative impacts on impressionable adolescents, both mentally and physically.\n\nHowever, the root cause of this problem is not the flashy lifestyle of celebrities. Evidently, the family and nurture environment rather than celebrities’ glamorous lifestyle, have more impact on shaping the behaviour of young people. It is important for everyone to learn to live within their means and to have a moral code of conduct. Furthermore, there are at least as many celebrities whose accomplishments make them excellent role models for young people. They demonstrate great effort, determination, and ambition, which is required for someone who wants to be truly successful in their chosen field.  \n\nIn conclusion, while superstars have impacts on the community, it is wrong to blame them for the wrongdoings of their young followers.

To what extent do you think consumers are influenced by advertisements? What measures can be taken to protect them?\n\nScore this IELTS Task 2 essay according to the rubric, ensuring alignment with the question:\n\nIn recent years rather than being well-informed about the details of newly launched products, people are bombarded with all kinds of advertisements. I believe the excessive popularity of advertisements has profound influences on customers and there are some measures which can protect them.\n\nThe increasing prevalence of advertising exerts several detrimental effects on consumers. First, commercials might stimulate people to purchase products that they do not really need. In order to approach prospective customers and create brand awareness, many enterprises tend to exaggerate the quality of their products. As a result, unwary consumers who are swayed by glamorous advertisements are easily tempted to impulsively buy goods that are of little use to them. Second, the rising popularity of advertising can also encourage people to form bad habits. For example, as youngsters are not mature enough to distinguish right from wrong or judge what is suitable within society, they might become addicted to playing video games if they are exposed to commercials promoting those products on a frequent basis.\n\nThere are several approaches that should be taken into consideration to protect consumers from the adverse effects of advertising. Governments should impose strict regulation on the advertising industry. Under stringent control, most businesses would be more responsible and truthful in promoting their products whether through online advertisements or commercial advertising on prime-time television. This would enable consumers to choose the most suitable and reliable products with greater trust and confidence. Additionally, consumers should have a thorough plan of what they are going to buy before they shop. By doing this, people will have time to prepare and make a wise decision about what products should be bought, which eventually save a great deal of money spent on unnecessary advertised goods.\n\nIn conclusion, although the excessive prevalence of advertising brings a lot of disadvantages to consumers, there are several effective approaches to protect consumers from the negative influences of advertising.\n\nProvide your assessment in the specified JSON format."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"per_criterion\": [{\"name\": \"Task Response\", \"band\": 8.0, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"I believe the excessive popularity of advertisements has profound influences on customers\", \"Governments should impose strict regulation on the advertising industry\", \"there are several effective approaches to protect consumers from the negative influences of advertising\"], \"errors\": [], \"suggestions\": [\"Expand on the examples of how advertising influences consumer behavior to strengthen the argument.\", \"Provide more specific details or statistics to support the claims about the detrimental effects of advertising.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Coherence & Cohesion\", \"band\": 7.0, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"the excessive popularity of advertisements has profound influences on customers\", \"Governments should impose strict regulation on the advertising industry\", \"there are several effective approaches to protect consumers from the negative influences of advertising\"], \"errors\": [], \"suggestions\": [\"Use more varied linking words to enhance the flow between ideas, such as 'furthermore' or 'in addition'.\", \"Consider using more specific examples to illustrate points, which can help to clarify arguments and improve cohesion.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Lexical Resource\", \"band\": 7.0, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"the excessive popularity of advertisements has profound influences on customers\", \"the increasing prevalence of advertising exerts several detrimental effects on consumers\", \"Governments should impose strict regulation on the advertising industry\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"the rising popularity of advertising can also encourage people to form bad habits\", \"type\": \"word choice\", \"fix\": \"the increasing popularity of advertising can also encourage people to develop bad habits\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Incorporate more varied vocabulary to avoid repetition, such as using synonyms for 'advertising' and 'consumers'.\", \"Use more complex sentence structures to enhance the sophistication of the writing.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Grammatical Range & Accuracy\", \"band\": 8.0, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"the excessive popularity of advertisements has profound influences on customers\", \"Governments should impose strict regulation on the advertising industry\", \"people will have time to prepare and make a wise decision about what products should be bought\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"which eventually save a great deal of money spent on unnecessary advertised goods\", \"type\": \"subject-verb agreement\", \"fix\": \"which eventually saves a great deal of money spent on unnecessary advertised goods\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Ensure subject-verb agreement is maintained throughout the essay.\", \"Vary sentence structures further to enhance the overall grammatical range.\"]}], \"overall\": 7.5}"}]}

Nowadays, increasing fuel costs wouldn't be adequate to solve environmental issues since the community would continue using primary and faster transport. In addition, other reasons are included for the ecological unbalance, such as the deforest, Agropecuario, humans, etc. Thus, I strongly disagree with this trying solution.\r\n\r\nFirst of all, the car's engines have been changed to hybrid and electric cars, which helps solve some of the issues.

Additionally, more encouragement through some Public Policies made by the government and businesses with multimedia marketing to society starting to ride bikes, take the bus, or walk to their destinations instead of using the car. Second, a clear example that increasing fuel prices may not work is represented by the war between Russia and Ukraine, where the public continued filling their gas transport; instead, they only complained about the high costs.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, the high demand for meat, eggs, and dairy products humans has been contributing to the increase in deforestation. Thus, with plain land, the farmers or factories can raise more farm animals, like cows, goats, pigs, and chickens. These animals also pollute the land, rivers, and air on a large scale. On the other hand, another problem starts with the pollution everyone makes every day by not throwing the trash properly. This action impacts the whole cycle of nature and increases an environmental imbalance.\r\n\r\nIn general, changing other sectors of life, such as changes in vehicle engines and ecological reeducation, would help Mother Nature not to collapse in the future.

Therefore, they start to understand how to communicate with people and get on well with other people. For example, in Mongolia, children who play team sports are the most famous ones in their school. On the other hand, team sports seem to make children patient and invulnerable.

For example, team projects, excursions, and even games can help children with this ability.

In my view, mankind has benefited more from this advancement. My upcoming essay will elaborate more on this.  \n\nFirstly, Humans have evolved rapidly in the past 30 years, to be more dependent on electronic devices. For instance, a lot of our everyday house chores have now been replaced by appliances, such as vacuum cleaners, Blenders and dishwashers etc. As a result, we have saved our self’s time and effort’s. For example, It took us an hour to cut the grass of our backyard and now we can get it done in minutes with the help of grass cutter.\n\nSecondly, we have become very much dependent on these machines to do all our work at home. As a result,we have become victim's to lazieness.This has caused chronic disease. Such as, Diabetes, Hypertension etc. Additionally, we spend more money in buying these home appliances and their maintenance. One clear example is electrical stove,It costs more to buy as compared to cooking on wood.\n\nTo conclude, I strongly believe that mechanical devices have taken over alot of our daily house work and that has helped us in saving our precious time.Moreover,It has also made our life simpler and more reliable.In Addition,this has brought comfort to our house by eliminating the hard work and attention that was once a required to complete the job by hand.  \n\n\nProvide your assessment in the specified JSON format."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"per_criterion\": [{\"name\": \"Task Response\", \"band\": 4.5, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"mankind has benefited more from this advancement\", \"we have saved our self’s time and effort’s\", \"mechanical devices have taken over alot of our daily house work\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"a lot of tasks at the house were accomplished by hands\", \"type\": \"clarity\", \"fix\": \"a lot of tasks at home were accomplished by hand\"}, {\"span\": \"we have saved our self’s time and effort’s\", \"type\": \"grammar\", \"fix\": \"we have saved our time and effort\"}, {\"span\": \"we have become victim's to lazieness\", \"type\": \"grammar\", \"fix\": \"we have become victims of laziness\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Provide more specific examples to support the claim that machinery has benefited mankind.\", \"Clarify the negative impacts of dependency on machines to create a more balanced argument.\", \"Improve the organization of ideas to enhance the overall coherence of the essay.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Coherence & Cohesion\", \"band\": 3.5, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"In my view, mankind has benefited more from this advancement.\", \"As a result, we have saved our self’s time and effort’s.\", \"To conclude, I strongly believe that mechanical devices have taken over alot of our daily house work and that has helped us in saving our precious time.\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"self’s time and effort’s\", \"type\": \"possessive errors\", \"fix\": \"self's time and efforts\"}, {\"span\": \"victim's to lazieness\", \"type\": \"incorrect pluralization\", \"fix\": \"victims of laziness\"}, {\"span\": \"alot\", \"type\": \"spelling error\", \"fix\": \"a lot\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Use clearer topic sentences to guide the reader through each paragraph.\", \"Ensure proper punctuation and spacing after commas to improve readability.\", \"Avoid using informal phrases and ensure correct spelling to enhance the overall quality of the essay.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Lexical Resource\", \"band\": 3.5, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"mankind has benefited more from this advancement\", \"we have saved our self’s time and effort’s\", \"mechanical devices have taken over alot of our daily house work\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"self’s\", \"type\": \"possessive form\", \"fix\": \"self\"}, {\"span\": \"effort’s\", \"type\": \"possessive form\", \"fix\": \"efforts\"}, {\"span\": \"victim's to lazieness\", \"type\": \"incorrect plural\", \"fix\": \"victims of laziness\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Use a wider range of vocabulary to express ideas more clearly and accurately.\", \"Pay attention to the correct use of possessive forms and pluralization.\", \"Avoid redundancy and improve clarity by using more precise language.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Grammatical Range & Accuracy\", \"band\": 4.5, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"mankind has benefited more from this advancement\", \"we have saved our self’s time and effort’s\", \"mechanical devices have taken over alot of our daily house work\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"self’s\", \"type\": \"possessive form error\", \"fix\": \"self\"}, {\"span\": \"effort’s\", \"type\": \"possessive form error\", \"fix\": \"efforts\"}, {\"span\": \"victim's to lazieness\", \"type\": \"apostrophe misuse and spelling error\", \"fix\": \"victims of laziness\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Use plural forms correctly, such as 'efforts' instead of 'effort’s' and 'self' instead of 'self’s'.\", \"Ensure correct use of apostrophes and spelling, for example, 'victims of laziness' instead of 'victim's to lazieness'.\", \"Vary sentence structures to enhance grammatical range, such as using complex sentences to connect ideas more effectively.\"]}], \"overall\": 4.0}"}]}

So, it is normal that they have a huge effect on the common folk. At present, celebrities are more concerned about their lifestyle. They try to be in limelight, hence they are keeping themselves fit.

Secondly, in the ,world everyone works hard for earning money. If someone is recognized by his or her wealth, it will not create a bad impression on the young. Consequently, others will try to earn money by following them.

Firstly, in some companies, employers are asked for high academic qualifications. For example, some high-paying jobs such as statisticians or medical jobs requested master’s degree as a vital requirement. Secondly, since obtaining a university certificate is an indicator of perseverance and passion needed to study a degree course for about four years, a university degree is a proof of the competence of the applicants.

This essay believes that efforts to climate change should be strengthened rather than giving in due to the reasons below.\r\n\r\nFirst, it is the responsibility of humankind to mitigate the impacts of human activities on the environment, and education has a crucial role to play. The increase in temperature and rising sea level has been intensified since the beginning of the industrial revolution until now. Many activities common nowadays did not exist before that, for example the burning of fossil fuel to create electricity, lighting, and mobility needs. With a population reaching 8 billions, the amount of fuel for daily activities is huge. Meanwhile, the burning process is known for releasing CO2 which directly caused an increase in temperature. What is worse, cooling refrigerants, which are essential chemicals for fridges and air-conditioners to function, are made up of global warming gases such as CFCs and HFCs. The fact is that from furniture to devices and even lifestyles, human activities is the main source of global warming even though we may not be aware of it. Education about potentially harmful human activities and corresponding solutions are important to increase the diffusion rate of new environmental-friendly technologies, which will contribute to the final bottom lines of reserving impacts of climate change.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, some individuals claim that the adoption of environmental-friendly technologies and procedures increases costs for companies and consumers. They also argue that the debate for conservation has been a common topic, but actually the results to be felt is negligible. What is more, it is easier following conventional methods than making changes. Besides that, current lifestyle which relies on fossil fuel energy resources and plastic is more convenient than readily available compared to efforts in looking for alternatives which strive to serve the same ends.\r\n\r\nHowever, climate change seems inevitable because we as human being has not done enough on our parts. Government should take initiative in funding researches into low greenhouse emission materials and technologies, especially those with versatile application potentials. Corporates should make efforts to switch to environmental-friendly alternative products and operations where possible. End users and households should deliberate choose green products and solutions over traditional ones. \r\n\r\nIn a nutshell, resolving environmental issues is the task of the collective and should be included in daily activities for each of us. Unless everybody fulfils their roles, the impact will be exacerbated from abnormal to extreme weather conditions, from local to global. We should not trade off short-term convenience and the cheaper costs for a sustainable future because consequences will accumulate and our suffering days will be near.\n\nProvide your assessment in the specified JSON format."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"per_criterion\": [{\"name\": \"Task Response\", \"band\": 5.0, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"This essay believes that efforts to climate change should be strengthened rather than giving in due to the reasons below.\", \"First, it is the responsibility of humankind to mitigate the impacts of human activities on the environment, and education has a crucial role to play.\", \"In a nutshell, resolving environmental issues is the task of the collective and should be included in daily activities for each of us.\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"the adoption of environmental-friendly technologies and procedures increases costs for companies and consumers\", \"type\": \"lack of clarity\", \"fix\": \"Clarify how the costs relate to the effectiveness of environmental-friendly technologies.\"}, {\"span\": \"the results to be felt is negligible\", \"type\": \"subject-verb agreement\", \"fix\": \"Change 'is' to 'are' to match the plural subject 'results'.\"}, {\"span\": \"we as human being has not done enough on our parts\", \"type\": \"subject-verb agreement\", \"fix\": \"Change 'has' to 'have' to match the plural subject 'we'.\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Provide more specific examples of successful environmental initiatives to strengthen arguments.\", \"Clarify the counterarguments presented to ensure a balanced discussion.\", \"Improve the organization of ideas to enhance the overall coherence of the essay.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Coherence & Cohesion\", \"band\": 4.0, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"this essay believes that efforts to climate change should be strengthened rather than giving in due to the reasons below.\", \"the adoption of environmental-friendly technologies and procedures increases costs for companies and consumers.\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"the amount of fuel for daily activities is huge.\", \"type\": \"lack of clarity\", \"fix\": \"Specify what 'huge' means in terms of quantity or impact.\"}, {\"span\": \"the results to be felt is negligible.\", \"type\": \"subject-verb agreement error\", \"fix\": \"Change 'is' to 'are' to match the plural subject 'results'.\"}, {\"span\": \"we as human being has not done enough on our parts.\", \"type\": \"subject-verb agreement error\", \"fix\": \"Change 'has' to 'have' to match the plural subject 'we'.\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Use clearer transitions between paragraphs to enhance the flow of ideas.\", \"Ensure subject-verb agreement throughout the essay to improve grammatical accuracy.\", \"Provide specific examples or data to support claims about the impacts of climate change and the effectiveness of solutions.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Lexical Resource\", \"band\": 4.0, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"the burning process is known for releasing CO2 which directly caused an increase in temperature\", \"the adoption of environmental-friendly technologies and procedures increases costs for companies and consumers\", \"resolving environmental issues is the task of the collective\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"8 billions\", \"type\": \"numerical expression\", \"fix\": \"8 billion\"}, {\"span\": \"human activities is the main source\", \"type\": \"subject-verb agreement\", \"fix\": \"human activities are the main source\"}, {\"span\": \"deliberate choose green products\", \"type\": \"word choice\", \"fix\": \"deliberately choose green products\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Use more precise numerical expressions, such as '8 billion' instead of '8 billions'.\", \"Ensure subject-verb agreement is maintained throughout the essay.\", \"Improve word choice by using adverbs correctly, such as 'deliberately' instead of 'deliberate'.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Grammatical Range & Accuracy\", \"band\": 5.0, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"the amount of fuel for daily activities is huge.\", \"the adoption of environmental-friendly technologies and procedures increases costs for companies and consumers.\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"8 billions\", \"type\": \"numerical agreement\", \"fix\": \"8 billion\"}, {\"span\": \"human activities is the main source\", \"type\": \"subject-verb agreement\", \"fix\": \"human activities are the main source\"}, {\"span\": \"we as human being has not done enough\", \"type\": \"subject-verb agreement\", \"fix\": \"we as human beings have not done enough\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Ensure subject-verb agreement, especially with plural subjects.\", \"Use correct numerical forms, such as 'billion' instead of 'billions' when referring to a singular quantity.\", \"Vary sentence structures to enhance grammatical range, such as using more complex sentences or different conjunctions.\"]}], \"overall\": 4.5}"}]}

In this essay I will look the reason behind this situation, and whether theirs cons outweighed to their drawbacks.\r\n\r\nTo begin with the reason I would say, our modern life make people busy to pursue their career. Instead of, building their own families, moreover the number of people who are not ready to have kids increase each and every day, for instance there is apartment in our neighborhood, 4 guys live there, and who have a good career path. However they are not ready for marriage. And, the old people in my neighborhood, they tell them every day, rather than living in solo you may live in classic way that we were use to live in our ages. But, they always reply, why we are rushing? We are still young.\r\n\r\nAdvantages of having children in late age is good in many sides, first it will decrease the divorce rate which leads that the children would not get enough care for separated parents. Second, when people worked all that time their finances could be good. So, they can mange needs of their children, because now everything is a double for their original price, while in the past decades live were easier. As result of that, preparation before being parent will be good.\r\n\r\nDisadvantages are much more intense than advantages. Because. When people get old they cannot play, be friends for their children due to healthy issues. Nevertheless, the fertility rate of the person will be decline as the age increase and, leads to not having kids or it will be difficult. to illustrate, one day I was in the hospital I saw a woman, we talk like usually she was waiting her results from the laboratory, she gave me advice, she said marry at an early in order to have babies. Otherwise you will be like me I stand every day in front of hospital for hoping to increase my chance of pregnancy. \r\n\r\nIn conclusion, not matter what condition that you want to push back.

To what extent do you agree or disagree?\n\nScore this IELTS Task 2 essay according to the rubric, ensuring alignment with the question:\n\nMany people argue that in order to fight diseases, the government should invest more money in encouraging a healthy lifestyle instead of spending capital on the treatment of patients. I partly agree with this point of view for a number of reasons, which will be outlined in this essay.\r\n\r\nTo begin with, there are a few reasons why society has an idea that public property should be spent on the medication of ill people. One of the main reasons is that, in terms of treatment, the investment of the government in medical facilities or hospitals is critical to patients, especially those who can not afford their operations. It means that the authority should create a welfare policy for serious diseases such as cancer or cardiovascular, which require a large cost for treatments. As a result, many people can have access to treatment. Another reason is that vaccination for some diseases requires financial support from the government. To illustrate, during the COVID-19 pandemic, the fee for vaccinating against the COVID-19 virus is free for citizens thanks to public money; Consequently, the effect of the virus has decreased as more than 80% of citizens have been vaccinated. \r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the idea that public wealth should be spent more on promoting a healthy lifestyle for society also has many benefits. The first factor that earns my support is that the improvement of good health is relatively cheaper than cure in several cases. For instance, campaigns and propaganda to encourage the citizens to live healthier should be broadcast on television and other forms of media. Another factor is that investment in public infrastructure should be given more attention. In fact, parks and sports centres should be built more so that residents can come and exercise regularly. Hence, the rate of people getting sick would decrease and the resistance is better. Furthermore, another factor is that many medical conditions are the direct result of unhealthy habits leading to chronic disorders such as obesity, insomnia, or cancer. Additionally, health promotion and disease prevention initiatives can produce greater long-term social impacts.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, there is no denying that both opinions are well-grounded. In my opinion, the metropolitan should be aware of a healthy lifestyle, and the investment of the patients from the government should be a high priority.\n\nProvide your assessment in the specified JSON format."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"per_criterion\": [{\"name\": \"Task Response\", \"band\": 8.0, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"the government should invest more money in encouraging a healthy lifestyle instead of spending capital on the treatment of patients\", \"the improvement of good health is relatively cheaper than cure in several cases\", \"health promotion and disease prevention initiatives can produce greater long-term social impacts\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"the metropolitan should be aware of a healthy lifestyle\", \"type\": \"clarity\", \"fix\": \"replace 'the metropolitan' with 'the government' or 'authorities' for clarity\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Provide more specific examples of healthy lifestyle initiatives that could be funded by the government.\", \"Clarify the conclusion by summarizing the main points discussed in the essay to reinforce the argument.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Coherence & Cohesion\", \"band\": 7.0, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"the investment of the government in medical facilities or hospitals is critical to patients\", \"the idea that public wealth should be spent more on promoting a healthy lifestyle for society also has many benefits\", \"the improvement of good health is relatively cheaper than cure in several cases\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"the investment of the patients from the government should be a high priority\", \"type\": \"clarity\", \"fix\": \"rephrase to clarify that the investment should be in patient care, not from patients\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Use clearer transitions between points to enhance the flow of ideas.\", \"Ensure that conclusions clearly reflect the arguments made in the essay for better coherence.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Lexical Resource\", \"band\": 7.0, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"the investment of the government in medical facilities or hospitals is critical to patients\", \"the improvement of good health is relatively cheaper than cure in several cases\", \"health promotion and disease prevention initiatives can produce greater long-term social impacts\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"the investment of the patients from the government should be a high priority\", \"type\": \"word choice\", \"fix\": \"the investment in the treatment of patients by the government should be a high priority\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Use more varied vocabulary to express similar ideas, such as replacing 'good health' with 'well-being' or 'wellness'.\", \"Consider using more precise terms instead of general phrases, for example, 'public wealth' could be replaced with 'government funds' or 'public resources'.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Grammatical Range & Accuracy\", \"band\": 8.0, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"the investment of the government in medical facilities or hospitals is critical to patients\", \"campaigns and propaganda to encourage the citizens to live healthier should be broadcast on television and other forms of media\", \"the improvement of good health is relatively cheaper than cure in several cases\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"the investment of the patients from the government should be a high priority\", \"type\": \"word choice\", \"fix\": \"the investment in patients by the government should be a high priority\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Consider varying sentence structures to enhance the complexity of your writing.\", \"Ensure that word choices accurately convey the intended meaning, particularly in formal contexts.\"]}], \"overall\": 7.5}"}]}

This essay will discuss both views, and then I will give my own perspective.\n\nSome may argue that working after high school helps those graduates develop an independent life and gives them an insight into their future careers. First, they can learn to live independently by managing their income. In Vietnam, students who choose to work after high school are more self-reliant adults who can cover the compounding costs of accommodation, transport, and food without asking their parents for a monthly spending allowance. Second, working provides students with the opportunity and time to observe how other people work in their workplaces. As a result, they may acquire a better understanding of their chosen profession and thus make a rational decision whether to go back to university or to run a business. \n\nSupporters of students’ furtherance of their education have their own reasons. One benefit is that a college education is a prerequisite for employment in certain professions. For instance, it is illegal to practice medicine or give legal advice without a relevant degree in most countries in the world. Another benefit is that compared to those having only work experience, people who also have academic credentials would stand a higher chance of rising to the top and becoming leaders or managers of their companies. This is because the combined qualifications they possess can convince others that they have the necessary skills and relevant knowledge to regulate a company's operation.  \n\nIn conclusion, while there are good arguments supporting both views, it seems to me that pursuing higher education more likely leads to a rewarding career.

Most importantly, I believe that the advantages outweigh the disadvantages in the sense that, having children later in life gives them more insight as to how to take care of the youngster's physical, financial, and psychological needs, and also, how to note for signs of abnormalities. However, there are various complications like preeclampsia and an increased maternal death rate these problems could be easily handled with appropriate medical interventions. This essay will be discussed in the subsequent paragraph, relevant examples would be provided and a logical conclusion would be drawn.\r\n\r\nTo begin with, everything that has an advantage also has disadvantages, while many would argue that the disadvantages might be brutal. I would like to point out that the downsides such as preeclampsia and an increase in the maternal death rate could be easily managed with the inception of advanced medical equipment and close monitoring of both the mother and the fetus. For example, according to the research held in a teaching hospital in Nigeria, it was gathered that complications as a result of pregnancy in old age have reduced to about 3% with effective medical management.\r\n\r\nAlso, the merit of having a kid at an older age surpassed the demerits which could be easily managed. Not only does it give them the mental preparedness that is required to raise a youngster, but it also helps them to prepare for the financial burden of catering to the kid and providing appropriate basic amenities. The knowledge gathered through experience could also come in handy when it involves paying attention to abnormalities. For instance, according to an analysis that was collated in a hospital in England, it was noticed that children who suffer from infant death and diseases have parents that are younger and inexperienced.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, this essay discussed how the benefits of having children later in life are more important than the demerits which could easily be contained.

They are interested in learning more about their properties for a number of different reasons. The worth of the apartment or building is growing increasingly important in today's society, especially for owners who wish to sell. If a home or structure has a long history of housing celebrities, the price of the structure may rise sharply in the future. Because there are many families and individuals that are passionate about acquiring historic homes or structures today, there is undoubtedly interest in buying. Second, a lot of young people are starting to pay closer attention to how their predecessors once lived in their condominiums. In order to pass down their past in the home or building to their future children, they believe it to be of utmost importance. Additionally, it seems to be about carrying on a heritage and making their own history, both of which tend to be highly prized in later years. Last but not least, some people are very interested in fixing it or changing it over time to suit their own tastes; as a result, they need to get hold of their house's previous instructions before the repair date, procedures, or fixed parts in the first place. They must therefore make plans and research the past of their properties.They are aware of which portions of their house need to be repaired and which components might be changed without doing any damage if they had a grasp of the past repair instruction for their home. Therefore, understanding the historical context of their homes and buildings requires a few fundamental concepts. First, they should consult their elderly grandparents who have lived in that residence their entire lives. Additionally, the best way to learn what happened in someone's home, what events took place, who lived there previously, etc., is to ask about the nearby neighbourhood. There are numerous hints that could come to light if you ask those people. Second, they can be researching information on their buildings on websites. There are numerous platforms that might aid in knowledge. For instance, if a person's home appears to have a long past, they can search on Wikipedia or go to websites like Propertysale.com or Househistory.mn, etc. Asking your real estate agents or past property owners, who have worked with you, is another way to learn about their residences. They may have extensive knowledge about the state of their old home. In a nutshell, these are the common techniques for learning about the past of apartments or other structures.

Some people stated that a rise in cost of fuel is the only way to improve this problem. From my perspective, increasing in petrol price may be reasonable to some extent; however, this solution remains several drawbacks.\r\n\r\nOn the one hand, setting a higher cost for fuel will be beneficial in some aspects of alleviating severe pollution problems nowadays. Firstly, the rate of air pollution will improve significantly as the amount of carbon emission decreases. Since people are restricted to traveling by vehicles, they would commute on foot or by bicycles more often, which, in turn, reduces a considerable amount of carbon footprint released per day. Secondly, the solution also assists in preventing the dramatic degradation of renewable resources. As less fuel is consumed, the frequency of exploitation of natural resources will gradually lessen over time, allowing them to renew faster. \r\n\r\nOn the other hand, there will doubtlessly occurs some problems when establishing fuel price escalation. It is evident that the decline in petrol consumption will result in a loss of profit for petroleum industry. As the number of fuel consumers decreases, it will be a daunting task for companies to maintain due to the lack of operating expenditure; some may even undergo bankruptcy. Moreover, higher costs of fuel may bring about shrinkage in daily expenses for people, especially those who accommodate in rural areas. Consequently, they will have to cut down on the money spared for other basic needs; hence, their life standard may be negatively impacted.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, concerns on the surrounding environment can be mitigated by increasing price of petrol; nevertheless, some existing disadvantages should be taken into great consideration for the sake of a balance society.\n\nProvide your assessment in the specified JSON format."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"per_criterion\": [{\"name\": \"Task Response\", \"band\": 6.0, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"increasing in petrol price may be reasonable to some extent\", \"setting a higher cost for fuel will be beneficial in some aspects of alleviating severe pollution problems\", \"concerns on the surrounding environment can be mitigated by increasing price of petrol\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"environmental issues has never failed\", \"type\": \"subject-verb agreement\", \"fix\": \"environmental issues have never failed\"}, {\"span\": \"there will doubtlessly occurs some problems\", \"type\": \"verb form error\", \"fix\": \"there will doubtlessly occur some problems\"}, {\"span\": \"for the sake of a balance society\", \"type\": \"word form error\", \"fix\": \"for the sake of a balanced society\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Ensure subject-verb agreement throughout the essay.\", \"Use consistent verb forms to maintain grammatical accuracy.\", \"Pay attention to word forms to enhance clarity and precision in language.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Coherence & Cohesion\", \"band\": 5.0, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"setting a higher cost for fuel will be beneficial in some aspects of alleviating severe pollution problems nowadays.\", \"there will doubtlessly occurs some problems when establishing fuel price escalation.\", \"concerns on the surrounding environment can be mitigated by increasing price of petrol;\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"environmental issues has never failed\", \"type\": \"subject-verb agreement\", \"fix\": \"environmental issues have never failed\"}, {\"span\": \"there will doubtlessly occurs some problems\", \"type\": \"subject-verb agreement\", \"fix\": \"there will doubtlessly occur some problems\"}, {\"span\": \"for the sake of a balance society\", \"type\": \"article usage\", \"fix\": \"for the sake of a balanced society\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Ensure subject-verb agreement throughout the essay to improve clarity.\", \"Use more linking phrases to connect ideas between sentences and paragraphs for better flow.\", \"Revise the conclusion to clearly summarize the main points and reinforce the argument.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Lexical Resource\", \"band\": 5.0, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"the rate of air pollution will improve significantly\", \"the frequency of exploitation of natural resources will gradually lessen over time\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"environmental issues has never failed\", \"type\": \"subject-verb agreement\", \"fix\": \"environmental issues have never failed\"}, {\"span\": \"there will doubtlessly occurs some problems\", \"type\": \"verb form error\", \"fix\": \"there will doubtlessly occur some problems\"}, {\"span\": \"for the sake of a balance society\", \"type\": \"article error\", \"fix\": \"for the sake of a balanced society\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Focus on subject-verb agreement to ensure grammatical accuracy.\", \"Use more varied vocabulary to enhance the richness of the essay.\", \"Pay attention to article usage to improve the overall fluency of the writing.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Grammatical Range & Accuracy\", \"band\": 6.0, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"setting a higher cost for fuel will be beneficial in some aspects of alleviating severe pollution problems nowadays.\", \"the frequency of exploitation of natural resources will gradually lessen over time, allowing them to renew faster.\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"environmental issues has never failed\", \"type\": \"subject-verb agreement\", \"fix\": \"environmental issues have never failed\"}, {\"span\": \"there will doubtlessly occurs some problems\", \"type\": \"verb form\", \"fix\": \"there will doubtlessly occur some problems\"}, {\"span\": \"concerns on the surrounding environment\", \"type\": \"preposition use\", \"fix\": \"concerns about the surrounding environment\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Ensure subject-verb agreement is maintained throughout the essay.\", \"Use correct verb forms to match the subject in terms of number.\", \"Pay attention to preposition usage to enhance clarity and accuracy.\"]}], \"overall\": 5.5}"}]}

From my perspective, I totally disagree with the statement. \n\nFirstly, we should not treat juvenile criminals and adult ones the same, because a majority of those children are not educated sufficiently or correctly in schools. In other words, in these days, schools have focusing extremely on academic knowledge, such as maths or physics without teaching students about morality and philosophy. As a result, those pupils are not able to distinguish whether what they do is right or wrong.

In the modern life, an increasing number of young individuals use social networking websites and they are likely to be captivated by sensations stories and breaking news which relate to violence.

Most scientists agree that global warming presents the greatest threat to the environment. \n\nThere is little doubt that the  Earth is getting warmer. In the last ,century the average temperature rose about 0.6 degrees C around the world. Many experts warn that global warming will  cause sea levels to rise dramatically. In the last 100 ,years the oceans have risen 10 to 20 CMS which may cause some coastal areas with lower elevations may be submerged. At the same time, climate change is likely to impact on ecosystems, agriculture and the spread of diseases.\"Global warming is a\n\nserious threat to animal and plant life,' says JayMalcolm, a forestry professor at the University of Toronto. As the climate warms, more southerly species will begin appearing further north, the species will find themselves in habitats where they don't belong.\n\nHowever what just caused this series of changes? Just as the evidence is clear that temperatures have risen in the last century, it's also well established that carbon dioxide in the Earth's atmosphere has increased about 30 per cent, allowing the atmosphere to trap too much heat.

This essay will discuss about the main cause and a couple of solutions to tackle the issue.\r\n\r\nOn the one hand, the foremost reason that leads to a negative impact is due to an enormous amout of litter thrown away annually. The more goods are produced, the more garbage exist. It is easy to catch the moment that many tourists acquiring little education about environmental protection leave their own trash on roads and beaches. Not only people from tourisms but also local inhabitants that are not aware of collecting those garbage. Second, most of factories are utilizing unfriendly environmetally materials such as fossil fuels which may release hazardous emissions. For instance, the toxic smoke released into the atmosphere together with pollutants pumped directly to the sea can result in the air and water pollution.\r\n\r\nHowever, the ways to handle this situation are varied. It is nothing but the duty of the government in protecting the ecology by setting obligatory. For example, the authorities are able to impose stricter punishment on companies that go to great lengths to produce things from bad materials such as nilon. Furthermore, local residents should also establish some environmental protection groups to launch campaigns like ‘gathering trash on a weekly basis’ and apply cutting-edge technologies to have proper packages for each product.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, it is obvious that the reasons why the development of consumer goods does harm to the natural environment are owing to the huge wealth of litter and the toxic materials.

Personally, I completely agree with this statement because it will lead to positive outcomes for students' performance. \r\n\r\nTeaching students to work together with other school-children through team sports is advantageous and beneficial. Primarily,  team sport involves a cordial relationship between school children. For example, team games where numerous students are taking part to help  isolated ones to perform better. Additionally, it helps  to broaden perspectives because of sharing, exchanging ideas and information with peers. Hence, it provides to children to be open-minded, overcome shyness in a new unknown environment and learn more information from their classmates.\r\n\r\nApart from being socialized, team games boost the interpersonal skills of students. In other words, members of the game adapted to listen to others' opinions and  have the same rights to speak. For instance, if children listen to each other and get the required advice from their classmates among the game members, the team would do the game efficiently which leads to winners. Thus, these skills will be vital to students further and provide  numerous benefits, namely being a comfortable person as well as a colleague.\r\n\r\nTo conclude,  the best method in order to promote cooperating skills in students is to teach them through team games at school.

The government can use executive and legal measures, which none of the other organizations can do, to contain these behaviours. For example, the London government passed the law of clean air and took measures to help residents get rid of burning coal for heating in the 1950s to fight against the great smog which potentially caused thousands of deaths during the period.\r\n\r\nSecond, health is highly relevant to habitat conditions. Research has shown that more than a hundred physical and mental illness is related to pollution and living quality. Such problems can partly be solved by a well urban planning and organization, which is the government’s duty. For instance, a city with well-designed architecture can place people in desirable surroundings and ease their mental stress with good scenery and society.\r\n\r\nIn a word, improving the environment and accommodation should be placed in the prior position on the government’s to-do list.\n\nProvide your assessment in the specified JSON format."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"per_criterion\": [{\"name\": \"Task Response\", \"band\": 7.0, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"it’s the government’s responsibility to improve the surrounding quality for citizens\", \"the government is the only entity that has the power of protecting the environment\", \"improving the environment and accommodation should be placed in the prior position on the government’s to-do list\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"a well urban planning and organization\", \"type\": \"grammatical error\", \"fix\": \"well urban planning and organization should be 'well-planned urban organization'\"}, {\"span\": \"the law of clean air\", \"type\": \"inaccuracy\", \"fix\": \"should refer to it as 'the Clean Air Act'\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Provide more specific examples or data to support claims about the impact of government actions on health and the environment.\", \"Clarify the conclusion by summarizing the main points discussed in the essay to reinforce the argument.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Coherence & Cohesion\", \"band\": 6.0, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"the government is the only entity that has the power of protecting the environment\", \"health is highly relevant to habitat conditions\", \"improving the environment and accommodation should be placed in the prior position on the government’s to-do list\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"a well urban planning and organization\", \"type\": \"grammatical error\", \"fix\": \"well-designed urban planning and organization\"}, {\"span\": \"the law of clean air\", \"type\": \"inconsistency\", \"fix\": \"the Clean Air Act\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Use clearer topic sentences to better guide the reader through each paragraph's main idea.\", \"Ensure consistent terminology when referring to laws or concepts to avoid confusion.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Lexical Resource\", \"band\": 6.0, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"Illness and disease can be a heavy burden for families in poor situations.\", \"the government is the only entity that has the power of protecting the environment.\", \"health is highly relevant to habitat conditions.\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"more than a hundred physical and mental illness\", \"type\": \"subject-verb agreement\", \"fix\": \"more than a hundred physical and mental illnesses\"}, {\"span\": \"a well urban planning and organization\", \"type\": \"article usage\", \"fix\": \"well urban planning and organization\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Use more varied vocabulary to express ideas, such as synonyms for 'government' or 'environment'.\", \"Pay attention to subject-verb agreement and ensure that plural nouns are correctly formed.\", \"Improve the use of articles to enhance grammatical accuracy.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Grammatical Range & Accuracy\", \"band\": 7.0, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"the government is the only entity that has the power of protecting the environment\", \"Research has shown that more than a hundred physical and mental illness is related to pollution and living quality\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"more than a hundred physical and mental illness\", \"type\": \"subject-verb agreement\", \"fix\": \"more than a hundred physical and mental illnesses\"}, {\"span\": \"a well urban planning and organization\", \"type\": \"article usage\", \"fix\": \"well urban planning and organization\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Ensure subject-verb agreement is maintained, especially with plural nouns.\", \"Review article usage to ensure correct forms are used before nouns.\"]}], \"overall\": 6.5}"}]}

Therefore, the machines have taken control over the jobs and tasks that required excessive physical activity. Analysing the role of machines, I believe that this is a positive development as it could provide more accuracy for production and do tasks which are not possible for humans.\r\n\r\nFirstly, to err is to human and they cannot do the job with the same accuracy as that of technology. Taking this into account, 100 workers in a factory of food making are not efficient to find the error being made which could be easily detected by the machine. Certainly, the precision rate is extremely high if tasks are being conducted by robots. Therefore, AI has more efficient as compared to manpower considering the accuracy it could achieve. \r\n\r\nSecondly, labour could do extremely difficult activities like repetition movement but somehow they lack in life heavy weights that are beyond human capacity. Although some workers have the potential to lift, not as much as lifting equipment can pick. For example, forklifts are a basic necessity of warehouses nowadays because of their power to carry bulk material around also, they could help store it to load at height. Consequently, this sort of task is not achievable by employees. \r\n\r\nIn conclusion, the development of equipment to work in warehouses has improved the quality of production and it can easily do the work which is impossible in the case of humans.

However, I disagree with the idea that every urban area should have such spaces; some cities are obliged to tend to other much-needed infrastructure and service improvement. \n\nThe presence of squares and parks certainly produces many benefits. Firstly, these places promote exercise among city dwellers, bringing a positive change to their sedentary lifestyle. Moreover, such green spaces regulate air temperature and absorb atmospheric pollutants, which helps reduce health risks inherent in many cities and towns. Secondly, public venues can be used for important events and holidays, or as tourist attractions that help generate incomes and boost local economies. Times Square in New York City, for example, attracts millions of visitors a year, and it is considered one of the major economic drivers for the city.\n\nNevertheless, it would be impractical to make public spaces an absolute necessity because some cities are faced with more urgent issues which should be prioritised. As people move to cities for jobs, there is an urgent need for living spaces. Therefore, instead of using lands for huge public spaces, city officials may use them to provide accommodation for the increasing population. Also, constructing and maintaining public facilities can take up a significant portion of a city budget, which otherwise can be used for more pressing needs of urban residents. For instance, it is more important for some cities to build more hospitals or combat unemployment rather than create recreational places for the public. \n\nIn conclusion, I do not believe that all cities need to invest in building public places as some have to allocate their space and financial resources for weightier matters.\n\nProvide your assessment in the specified JSON format."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"per_criterion\": [{\"name\": \"Task Response\", \"band\": 8.0, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"some cities are obliged to tend to other much-needed infrastructure and service improvement.\", \"it would be impractical to make public spaces an absolute necessity because some cities are faced with more urgent issues which should be prioritised.\", \"I do not believe that all cities need to invest in building public places as some have to allocate their space and financial resources for weightier matters.\"], \"errors\": [], \"suggestions\": [\"Provide more specific examples of cities that face urgent issues to strengthen the argument.\", \"Elaborate on the types of infrastructure and services that should be prioritized over public spaces.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Coherence & Cohesion\", \"band\": 7.0, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"the idea that every urban area should have such spaces\", \"public venues can be used for important events and holidays\", \"some cities are faced with more urgent issues which should be prioritised\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"which otherwise can be used for more pressing needs of urban residents\", \"type\": \"lack of clarity\", \"fix\": \"clarify what 'which' refers to, e.g., 'the city budget can be used for more pressing needs of urban residents'\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Use clearer references to avoid ambiguity, ensuring that pronouns clearly refer to their antecedents.\", \"Consider using more cohesive devices, such as linking words and phrases, to enhance the flow between ideas.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Lexical Resource\", \"band\": 7.0, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"such green spaces regulate air temperature and absorb atmospheric pollutants\", \"public venues can be used for important events and holidays\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"weightier matters\", \"type\": \"collocation error\", \"fix\": \"more pressing matters\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Incorporate a wider range of synonyms to avoid repetition, particularly for terms like 'public spaces' and 'cities'.\", \"Use more complex sentence structures to demonstrate a higher level of lexical sophistication.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Grammatical Range & Accuracy\", \"band\": 8.0, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"these places promote exercise among city dwellers, bringing a positive change to their sedentary lifestyle.\", \"public venues can be used for important events and holidays, or as tourist attractions that help generate incomes and boost local economies.\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"which should be prioritised\", \"type\": \"tense consistency\", \"fix\": \"which should be prioritized\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Vary sentence structures further by incorporating more complex sentences.\", \"Use more advanced vocabulary to enhance the sophistication of the essay.\"]}], \"overall\": 7.5}"}]}

Secondly, gas stations may cause a danger to the wildlife in the area. \r\n\r\nTo start with, vehicles produce a high amount of carbon dioxide through the exhaust pipe. Which causes global warming.

To what extent do you agree or disagree?\n\nScore this IELTS Task 2 essay according to the rubric, ensuring alignment with the question:\n\nHousing shortage has become a serious urban social issue in many parts of the world. It has been argued that only when the government has taken actions, can demand for homes be fulfilled. Yet to the best of my knowledge, the government alone can not cope well with housing shortage.\r\nOne of the main objections to government intervention is that it would hamper the private sector and simultaneously pose a huge burden upon the state. In countries where the government is on a tight budget and the homeless population is large, the involvement of private property developers is required and recommended. Not only does it release the government from the burden of funding large-sized construction programmes but it also fosters the housing industry. Given its role in attracting public consumption and accelerating economic development, the housing industry should be at the mercy of the market, rather than the government.\r\nAnother drawback of state control over the housing market is that it could result in the stagnancy of construction quality, functionality, facilities and other aspects of housing. Apartment blocks or other residential constructions would be built in a similar pattern and the cityscape would be monotonous. Excessive uniformity, especially in the size and number of rooms, will fail to meet comprehensive requirements raised by citizens on properties.\r\nDespite these objections, government intervention is essential in some segments of the market and can render more resistance to citizens. Single parents, the people with disabilities and other disadvantaged people are among those who are not ready to afford commercial housing. The government can provide them either with housing allowance to purchase their private properties or directly with economical houses.\r\nAs indicated above, in addressing homelessness and inadequate housing, the joint effort of both government and private sector is required.

Although employees do most part of the work, I believe that the directors should receive higher salaries.\n\nOn the one hand, some would think that it is unfair for the workers to receive less money. To illustrate, the workers are the ones who do and finish the job. People would argue whether a director is necessary since they do not make any difference in the company. For example, in the manufacturing industry, the employees do the tasks, while the leaders are just having meetings. However, I believe that they haven’t realized that they are just performing the most basic activities that can be easily replaced by others, while the work done by the director plays an important role in the whole company, because they are capable of resolving difficult problems.\n\nOn the other hand, managers should receive higher wages than other workers. This is because they have more responsibilities and more difficult work. They need to be sure that the organization is going in the right way and that everything is under control, At the same time, the leaders need to review the work done by the ordinary workers, in case it is wrong, the leader would need to take the managerial responsibility. For instance, in large companies, directors work more than 80 hours a week to finish their job and revise the work done by the employees ensuring that everything is correct. I believe managers are worthy to be paid more than the normal workers\n\nIn conclusion, although the workers do a big part of the labour and some would think that is unfair to give more money to the leaders, the managers take responsibility for all the work done by the ordinary employees and also are the ones in charge of correct it, therefore, I believe that the directors deserve a higher salary.\n\nProvide your assessment in the specified JSON format."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"per_criterion\": [{\"name\": \"Task Response\", \"band\": 8.5, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"I believe that the directors should receive higher salaries.\", \"managers should receive higher wages than other workers.\", \"the managers take responsibility for all the work done by the ordinary employees\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"At the same time, the leaders need to review the work done by the ordinary workers, in case it is wrong, the leader would need to take the managerial responsibility.\", \"type\": \"clarity\", \"fix\": \"Consider breaking this sentence into two for better clarity.\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Provide more specific examples or evidence to support the argument that directors' roles are more valuable.\", \"Clarify the distinction between the roles of workers and managers to strengthen the argument.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Coherence & Cohesion\", \"band\": 7.5, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"the managers should receive more money than the ordinary workers\", \"the workers do a big part of the labour and some would think that is unfair to give more money to the leaders\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"the leader would need to take the managerial responsibility\", \"type\": \"sentence structure\", \"fix\": \"the leaders would need to take managerial responsibility\"}, {\"span\": \"the managers take responsibility for all the work done by the ordinary employees and also are the ones in charge of correct it\", \"type\": \"grammar\", \"fix\": \"the managers take responsibility for all the work done by the ordinary employees and are also in charge of correcting it\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Use clearer transitions between ideas to enhance the flow of arguments.\", \"Ensure subject-verb agreement and proper tense usage for grammatical accuracy.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Lexical Resource\", \"band\": 7.5, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"the directors should receive higher salaries\", \"the work done by the director plays an important role in the whole company\", \"managers should receive higher wages than other workers\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"the leaders need to review the work done by the ordinary workers, in case it is wrong, the leader would need to take the managerial responsibility\", \"type\": \"word choice\", \"fix\": \"the leaders need to review the work done by the ordinary workers; if it is wrong, they would need to take managerial responsibility\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Vary vocabulary related to management and responsibility to enhance lexical diversity.\", \"Use more precise terms to describe roles and responsibilities, such as 'executives' instead of 'leaders' for clarity.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Grammatical Range & Accuracy\", \"band\": 8.5, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"the managers should receive more money than the ordinary workers\", \"they are capable of resolving difficult problems\", \"the managers take responsibility for all the work done by the ordinary employees\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"in case it is wrong, the leader would need to take the managerial responsibility\", \"type\": \"punctuation error\", \"fix\": \"in case it is wrong, the leader would need to take managerial responsibility\"}, {\"span\": \"the managers take responsibility for all the work done by the ordinary employees and also are the ones in charge of correct it\", \"type\": \"grammar error\", \"fix\": \"the managers take responsibility for all the work done by the ordinary employees and are also the ones in charge of correcting it\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Ensure subject-verb agreement and correct use of gerunds in sentences.\", \"Review punctuation, especially in complex sentences, to enhance clarity.\"]}], \"overall\": 8.0}"}]}

Although some argue that many customs are outdated and no longer serve a purpose, others believe that these traditions are an essential part of our culture and should be preserved. In my opinion, I agree with the latter group and believe that many customs and traditional ways of behaviour are worth keeping.\r\n\r\nFirstly, customs are an essential part of our cultural identity. They help us understand where we came from, and they provide us with a sense of belonging. Our traditions are what make us unique, and they connect us to our heritage. For example, the celebration of festivals and ceremonies is a tradition deeply ingrained in many cultures. These events bring people together and provide a platform to exchange ideas and share cultural experiences. As a result, traditional ways of behaviour are essential in promoting cultural diversity and social cohesion.\r\n\r\nSecondly, many customs and traditional ways of behaviour have practical benefits that are still relevant today. For instance, the practice of eating together as a family is a tradition that has been passed down through generations.p, and it has been shown to have many benefits, including improved communication and stronger family relationships. Similarly, many customs and traditional ways of behaviours that promote respect, honesty, and integrity are still essential in modern life. These values are universally recognized as positive, and they help to foster strong communities and relationships.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, even though some argue that customs and traditional ways of behaviour are outdated and no longer relevant, I believe that they are an essential part of our culture and should be preserved.\n\nProvide your assessment in the specified JSON format."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"per_criterion\": [{\"name\": \"Task Response\", \"band\": 8.0, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"I agree with the latter group and believe that many customs and traditional ways of behaviour are worth keeping.\", \"customs are an essential part of our cultural identity.\", \"they help us understand where we came from, and they provide us with a sense of belonging.\"], \"errors\": [], \"suggestions\": [\"Expand on the counterargument to provide a more balanced view.\", \"Include specific examples of customs that are still relevant today to strengthen the argument.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Coherence & Cohesion\", \"band\": 7.0, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"customs are an essential part of our cultural identity.\", \"traditional ways of behaviour are essential in promoting cultural diversity and social cohesion.\", \"I believe that they are an essential part of our culture and should be preserved.\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"behaviour are worth keeping.\", \"type\": \"inconsistent terminology\", \"fix\": \"Use 'behaviors' consistently instead of alternating between 'behaviour' and 'behaviors'.\"}, {\"span\": \"behaviour have practical benefits that are still relevant today.\", \"type\": \"grammatical error\", \"fix\": \"Change 'behaviour' to 'behaviors' for subject-verb agreement.\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Ensure consistent use of terminology throughout the essay to enhance clarity.\", \"Vary sentence structures to improve flow and maintain reader engagement.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Lexical Resource\", \"band\": 7.0, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"customs are an essential part of our cultural identity\", \"they connect us to our heritage\", \"traditional ways of behaviour are essential in promoting cultural diversity and social cohesion\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"traditional ways of behaviours\", \"type\": \"word form\", \"fix\": \"traditional ways of behaviour\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Use more varied vocabulary to avoid repetition, such as synonyms for 'customs' and 'traditions'.\", \"Incorporate more complex sentence structures to enhance the sophistication of the writing.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Grammatical Range & Accuracy\", \"band\": 8.0, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"customs are an essential part of our cultural identity.\", \"they connect us to our heritage.\", \"these traditions are an essential part of our culture and should be preserved.\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"behaviour are worth keeping\", \"type\": \"subject-verb agreement\", \"fix\": \"behaviour is worth keeping\"}, {\"span\": \"behaviours that promote respect, honesty, and integrity\", \"type\": \"pluralization\", \"fix\": \"behaviour that promotes respect, honesty, and integrity\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Ensure subject-verb agreement is maintained throughout the essay.\", \"Use consistent singular or plural forms when referring to customs and behaviours.\"]}], \"overall\": 7.5}"}]}

Unfortunately, it is found that children in schools are not engrossed in study. Does this mean that teachers are unqualified or are students themselves to blame? What are the remedies to overcome this problem?\r\nAdolescents’ innate characteristics should be brought into close scrutiny. Children, as non-grownups, are generally less self-disciplined. This means that they are ofttimes unable to control their concentration, easily affected by distractions such as a sudden sound or an idea that pops up and is unrelated with the class.  Each time students get sidetracked, they would miss the important points that teachers are elaborating. To combat this productivity-damaging weakness, there should be more research on strengthening children’s concentration. The ability to focus on important tasks for a longer duration of time could keep students from absent-mindedness and boost learning efficiency.\r\nAnother cause of this problem is attributed to ineffective teaching. These days, many teachers are not doing a good job. They constantly adopt teacher-centred methods in class, without taking into account students’ preferences.  This inappropriate method could demotivate students, making them lose interest in study. The solution would be to opt for a student-centred attitude. Teachers could integrate into their class livelier and more inspiring elements, so that the classes they teach would be more in line with young people’s taste.  With an intense interest in what the teachers are saying, the students would voluntarily engross themselves in these absorbing topics.\r\nIn summary, adolescents’ shortcoming in self-discipline and the mechanical teaching strategy chosen by teachers are held accountable for pupils’ inability to focus on study. The suggested recipes are to enhance those young people’s concentration and to put a higher value on what they are fond of.\n\nProvide your assessment in the specified JSON format."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"per_criterion\": [{\"name\": \"Task Response\", \"band\": 6.0, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"the quality of which requires the dedication of both students and teachers\", \"There should be more research on strengthening children’s concentration\", \"the mechanical teaching strategy chosen by teachers are held accountable for pupils’ inability to focus on study\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"the mechanical teaching strategy chosen by teachers are held accountable for pupils’ inability to focus on study\", \"type\": \"clarity and coherence\", \"fix\": \"Revise to clarify the relationship between teaching strategies and student focus, e.g., 'the mechanical teaching strategies chosen by teachers contribute to pupils’ inability to focus on their studies.'\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Provide more specific examples of effective teaching methods that could enhance student engagement.\", \"Expand on the remedies proposed to give a clearer understanding of how they can be implemented.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Coherence & Cohesion\", \"band\": 5.0, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"the quality of which requires the dedication of both students and teachers\", \"Each time students get sidetracked, they would miss the important points that teachers are elaborating\", \"The solution would be to opt for a student-centred attitude\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"without taking into account students’ preferences\", \"type\": \"lack of clarity\", \"fix\": \"Specify what students' preferences are to enhance clarity.\"}, {\"span\": \"the mechanical teaching strategy chosen by teachers\", \"type\": \"vague reference\", \"fix\": \"Clarify what is meant by 'mechanical teaching strategy' with examples.\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Use clearer transitions between paragraphs to improve flow.\", \"Provide specific examples or details to support claims about students' preferences and teaching methods.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Lexical Resource\", \"band\": 5.0, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"Education plays a pivotal role in children’s developmental years\", \"the quality of which requires the dedication of both students and teachers\", \"this inappropriate method could demotivate students\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"non-grownups\", \"type\": \"inappropriate word choice\", \"fix\": \"children or minors\"}, {\"span\": \"absent-mindedness\", \"type\": \"overly complex vocabulary\", \"fix\": \"lack of focus\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Use simpler and more common vocabulary to improve clarity and accessibility.\", \"Vary sentence structures to enhance the overall flow and coherence of the essay.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Grammatical Range & Accuracy\", \"band\": 6.0, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"Education plays a pivotal role in children’s developmental years\", \"Children, as non-grownups, are generally less self-disciplined\", \"The ability to focus on important tasks for a longer duration of time could keep students from absent-mindedness\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"the quality of which requires the dedication of both students and teachers\", \"type\": \"sentence structure\", \"fix\": \"the quality of education requires the dedication of both students and teachers\"}, {\"span\": \"making them lose interest in study\", \"type\": \"word choice\", \"fix\": \"making them lose interest in studying\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Vary sentence structures to include more complex sentences for improved range.\", \"Use gerunds correctly to enhance clarity and grammatical accuracy.\"]}], \"overall\": 5.5}"}]}

To be more precise, the adverts that people see nowadays on TV or through the Internet are sometimes colourful with appealing animations, or trying to illustrate the effectiveness when promoting the products.

Although it can be argued that there is nothing we could do to tackle this issue, I firmly believe some resolutions can proceed from different stakeholders. \r\n\r\nOn the one hand, there are two reasons to argue that it is overdue to undertake the adverse effects of human activities on nature. Firstly, many wildlife habitats have been destroyed due to deforestation for economic purposes. We destroyed enormous rainforest areas and over-exploited natural resources, thus, demolished the nutrients, water, and shelters for animals and plants. As a result, thousands of species are reported lost to human activity. For instance, Western Black Rhino went extinct in 2011. Secondly, despite advanced science and technology, there have been challenges to revive various extinct species so far. The de-extinction programs require billions of investments, not only for genetic technologies but also for habitats conservation.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the collaboration of international and domestic stakeholders can deliver effective resolutions throughout regulation, intervention programs, and financial aids. The government should introduce laws to protect natural areas, such as logging or trophy hunting. These acts will not only conserve wildlife habitats but also deter species from extinction.

From my perspectives, while it is true that a trade cannot sustain without making money, I completely agree with the opinion that a company needs to develop socially.\r\n\r\nTo embark upon, there is an emphasis on businesses as a major element in the economic growth of a country. A variety of field sectors are the main sources of money which are regarded as the foundation of many other activities in a large number of nations. Take South Korea as a stark example, the employment of trading in complex technological parts in this country constitutes up to around 80% of its economy annually. What is more, by making money, businesses also serve as a large contributor to the betterment of thousands of peoples' lives. In fact, the high salaries offered by businesses enable citizens to get access to better life conditions with cutting-edge items like air conditioners or heaters.\r\n\r\nEntrepreneurs, on the other hand, also have to shoulder various social responsibilities to benefit both themselves and communities. With diverse communal activities, these companies can considerably enhance their image of social-friendly organizations, thus promoting people’s awareness of a high-profile company and boosting their product sales. There are, for example, a myriad of organizations all over the world applying this strategy to increase their income, namely Microsoft which allocates millions of dollars yearly to charity. Furthermore, businesses can also conduct social activities on a large scale, hence contributing to the combating of communal issues effectively. As a case in point, many charities possessed by such well-known entrepreneurs around the world as Google or Microsoft can raise incredibly huge funs of more than a million dollar and send them to aid the miserable on earth.\r\n\r\nTo sum up, from aforementioned reasons, although it is integral for the businesses earn wages, I side with those who think companies also need to accommodate social responsibilities.\n\nProvide your assessment in the specified JSON format."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"per_criterion\": [{\"name\": \"Task Response\", \"band\": 8.5, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"I completely agree with the opinion that a company needs to develop socially.\", \"Entrepreneurs, on the other hand, also have to shoulder various social responsibilities to benefit both themselves and communities.\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"the businesses earn wages\", \"type\": \"clarity\", \"fix\": \"businesses to earn wages\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Clarify the conclusion by explicitly restating the main argument regarding the balance between profit and social responsibility.\", \"Provide more specific examples of companies successfully integrating social responsibilities into their business models.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Coherence & Cohesion\", \"band\": 7.5, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"a company needs to develop socially\", \"businesses also serve as a large contributor to the betterment of thousands of peoples' lives\", \"companies can considerably enhance their image of social-friendly organizations\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"the combating of communal issues effectively\", \"type\": \"word choice\", \"fix\": \"the combating of community issues effectively\"}, {\"span\": \"raise incredibly huge funs of more than a million dollar\", \"type\": \"grammatical error\", \"fix\": \"raise incredibly large funds of more than a million dollars\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Ensure consistent use of terminology, such as replacing 'communal' with 'community' for clarity.\", \"Use clearer transitions between ideas to enhance the flow of the essay, particularly when introducing examples.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Lexical Resource\", \"band\": 7.5, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"a variety of field sectors are the main sources of money\", \"shoulder various social responsibilities to benefit both themselves and communities\", \"conduct social activities on a large scale\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"incredibly huge funs\", \"type\": \"word choice\", \"fix\": \"incredibly huge funds\"}, {\"span\": \"the businesses earn wages\", \"type\": \"grammar\", \"fix\": \"businesses to earn wages\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Use more precise vocabulary to enhance clarity, such as replacing 'funs' with 'funds'.\", \"Ensure grammatical structures are correct, particularly with verb forms and prepositions.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Grammatical Range & Accuracy\", \"band\": 8.5, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"there is an emphasis on businesses as a major element in the economic growth of a country.\", \"these companies can considerably enhance their image of social-friendly organizations.\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"the combating of communal issues effectively\", \"type\": \"preposition use\", \"fix\": \"the combating of community issues effectively\"}, {\"span\": \"a myriad of organizations all over the world applying this strategy\", \"type\": \"subject-verb agreement\", \"fix\": \"a myriad of organizations all over the world apply this strategy\"}, {\"span\": \"incredibly huge funs of more than a million dollar\", \"type\": \"plurality and article use\", \"fix\": \"incredibly huge funds of more than a million dollars\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Ensure consistent subject-verb agreement throughout the essay.\", \"Use precise terminology, particularly in terms of plurality and article usage.\", \"Vary sentence structures to enhance the overall grammatical range.\"]}], \"overall\": 8.0}"}]}

In this essay, I will present why the population set up an interest in historical buildings and how they can find information in terms of the buildings.\r\n\r\nTo begin with. The majority of the population preferred new types of accommodations that seem to mix with Western structures and buildings than traditional houses like a Hanok. However, nowadays historical residence places get a brilliant light from the public through various media like broadcasts and social media. Simultaneously, the public desires to live in those places or experience them through staying in a guest house or traditional activities. For example, one of the TV show programs presented when it comes to Hanok, which is a Korean traditional living place, with a diversity of professors in 2013. Moreover, several folks who watched this show began to find Hanok to stay for themselves and this trend lasted for a while.\r\n\r\nIn addition, when they want to live traditional building, they can use some methods such as asking friends and searching on the Internet and social publishing.

It is well known that it causes a lot of expenses in order to build a plethora of houses. Citizens don’t have enough financial income to build a house. If the government builds houses by tax, they can lower the number of people who does not have a house and receive money when citizens purchase homes.

If a lot of citizens move their place to suburb areas, there will be many house that is vacant. For example, South Korea recently gave money to the people who transferred their house to rural place. After this campaign, there was a abrupt increase in the rate of people who started to reside in a countryside. Furthermore, youngsters also started to relocate in suburban areas and seek a job there.

To what extent do you agree or disagree?\n\nScore this IELTS Task 2 essay according to the rubric, ensuring alignment with the question:\n\nRecently, the extent of the environmental problems we are facing has become so vast, that major policy changes are required on a global level. Several people believe that one of the most feasible solutions to these problems, is to increase fuel prices for vehicles. I personally disagree with this idea, and in this essay, I will elaborate on the possible hindrances that it could cause to the general population of a country. \nEffluents released by the combustion of fuel in automobiles is definitely one of the leading causes of air pollution. Often, the degree of damage done to the environment is so extensive, that it is either difficult or impossible to breathe with ease. This is especially true in large cities having a high population density, where innumerable vehicles hit the roads on a daily basis. However, increasing fuel prices would definitely not aid in solving the problem at hand in a way that benefits the public, especially in developing or underdeveloped countries. For example, in a developing country like India, the average per capita income is far below the poverty line. In this case, increasing petrol and diesel rates would make the commodity entirely inaccessible to the common man. Furthermore, this would lead to an increase in fares in public transport, thereby discouraging the public from using the service. An overall hike would be seen in the price of goods, due to the increase in their transportation costs, and low-income houses would face serious difficulties to make ends meet. \nSecondly, let us look at the adversities faced by countries where the constant rise of petrol prices is a pressing issue, by considering India as an example. The inflation of oil prices was a major cause of public outrage, as citizens claimed that the tax being placed on the product was excessive, while the government claimed it was essential. Hence, it is clear that though increasing gas prices seems like an airtight solution on paper, it would inevitably cause numerous difficulties in the lives of the public. Therefore, we must first consider educating people on the processes of car-pooling and the benefits it could have to both the environment, as well as their savings. Another possible answer could be the odd/even method, wherein citizens must alternate between using private transport and public facilities. \nIn conclusion, even though this method might bring about the desired result, it would give rise to several other issues. Therefore, I strongly believe that while the proposed solution might seem obvious, it is not possible to implement this on a global scale without putting the middle and lower classes under serious strain. \n\n\nProvide your assessment in the specified JSON format."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"per_criterion\": [{\"name\": \"Task Response\", \"band\": 8.0, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"I personally disagree with this idea, and in this essay, I will elaborate on the possible hindrances that it could cause to the general population of a country.\", \"Therefore, I strongly believe that while the proposed solution might seem obvious, it is not possible to implement this on a global scale without putting the middle and lower classes under serious strain.\"], \"errors\": [], \"suggestions\": [\"Provide more specific examples or data to support claims about the impact of fuel price increases on low-income households.\", \"Consider addressing potential counterarguments to strengthen the overall argument.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Coherence & Cohesion\", \"band\": 7.0, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"in this essay, I will elaborate on the possible hindrances that it could cause to the general population of a country.\", \"it is clear that though increasing gas prices seems like an airtight solution on paper, it would inevitably cause numerous difficulties in the lives of the public.\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"the average per capita income is far below the poverty line.\", \"type\": \"clarity\", \"fix\": \"Clarify the relationship between per capita income and the impact of fuel price increases.\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Use more linking words and phrases to enhance the flow between sentences and paragraphs.\", \"Ensure that all examples clearly relate back to the main argument to strengthen coherence.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Lexical Resource\", \"band\": 7.0, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"the extent of the environmental problems we are facing has become so vast\", \"the degree of damage done to the environment is so extensive\", \"it would inevitably cause numerous difficulties in the lives of the public\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"the commodity entirely inaccessible to the common man\", \"type\": \"word choice\", \"fix\": \"the commodity entirely inaccessible to the average person\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Use a wider range of synonyms to avoid repetition, such as replacing 'increase' with 'raise' or 'hike' in some instances.\", \"Incorporate more advanced vocabulary related to economics and environmental science to enhance the essay's sophistication.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Grammatical Range & Accuracy\", \"band\": 8.0, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"the extent of the environmental problems we are facing has become so vast, that major policy changes are required on a global level.\", \"increasing fuel prices would definitely not aid in solving the problem at hand in a way that benefits the public, especially in developing or underdeveloped countries.\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"the average per capita income is far below the poverty line.\", \"type\": \"subject-verb agreement\", \"fix\": \"the average per capita income is far below the poverty line.\"}, {\"span\": \"low-income houses would face serious difficulties to make ends meet.\", \"type\": \"preposition use\", \"fix\": \"low-income households would face serious difficulties in making ends meet.\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Vary sentence structures more by incorporating complex and compound sentences to enhance the overall fluency.\", \"Ensure subject-verb agreement is maintained throughout the essay for improved grammatical accuracy.\"]}], \"overall\": 7.5}"}]}

So people become less active and this may result in some health problems like obesity.\n\nOn the other hand, I would agree with those who argue that robots will play important positive roles in future society. The first role is that robots could operate in locations that humans cannot reach such as exploration of the outer space. They can act as extended eyes for humans enabling them to look beyond their visual boundaries. Moreover, robots will be used inside human bodies for monitoring their health and undertake surgery. The second role that will be played by robots is the helping of elderly and retired people with their daily life activities like cooking and cleaning. Finally, robots could do normal jobs quickly unlike human beings. Robots don not complain or get distracted or tired.

In my point of view, this trend would create several benefits but there would be some drawbacks arising.\nOn the other hand, attending indirectly interactive courses is immeasurably beneficial to both professors and students. In other words, online courses bring so a wealth of convenience to learners since they enable students to save their quality time and finance as well. To be more specific, students can take part in any courses that they are interested in regardless of geographical distance or travel cost, which helps to reduce various burdens and enhance the gross enrollment rate significantly due to this flexibility. In contrast, a fixed curriculum in traditional classes makes students arrange their time and own schedule passively, which can limit their time management skills. In Vietnam, for instance, during the quarantine, online classes offered to students enable them to acquire knowledge sufficiently in safety without any time pressure or extravagant price of traveling.\nOn the other hand, there are also compelling reasons why this trend may bring some disadvantages. To start with, students may lose face to face interaction in unsociable learning hours, which can lead to non-comprehensive development in several immensely essential skills including interpersonal and communicative ones. Therefore, students are not able to be well-equipped in seeking jobs in the future which can affect career path negatively. Also, without competitiveness among peers, learners can easily lose the drive to try their best in order to have their desired academic results.

In my opinion, I completely agree with the idea and will outline several reasons following in this essay.\r\n\r\nFirstly, participating in team sports at school helps children to improve their communication skills, which is essential for effective cooperation.

Some people, however, argue that instead of preventing it we should find a way to live with it. I completely disagree with this opinion, because I believe that we still have time to tackle this issue and reduce our impact on the climate of earth.\n\nGlobal warming is the main cause of climate change. If both the people and the governments take appropriate actions, this can be controlled to a great extent. For example, the governments should stop the generation of power from fossil fuels which cause more carbon emissions and increase global warming. Governments can also invest in green energy sources like wind, solar and hydropower. Another practical solution that the government can implement is to impose ‘green taxes’ on industries and vehicles which emit carbon. Individuals should also try to reduce their carbon footprint by limiting the use of private vehicles and consuming energy responsibly.\n\nTrying to live with climate change instead of preventing it is a dangerous idea because in the near future, climate change will make our planet inhabitable. Because of global warming polar ice is melting causing sea levels to rise. When the sea levels rise coastal cities will get submerged in water. Let us not forget the fact that almost all major cities in the world are extremely close to seas and oceans. Climate change also leads to various natural calamities like cyclones, flooding and drought.\n\nTo conclude, when there are so many ways to prevent climate change, I cannot agree with the argument that we should find a way to live with it.

This essay will discuss these views and  will provide my personal opinion of it. \r\n\r\nOn the one hand, rich people can easily get access to the current technology  compared with poor people. Usually, the latest technology is likely to be expensive and  be only acquired by those who can pay for it.  For example, rich people can afford to buy an expensive computer, which might allow them to have more opportunities either in employment or educational field, whereas poor people might have to work for several years before being able to buy a computer and then get more opportunities. This trend, benefit more often the rich people and leave poor people behind, which in other words creates a gap \r\n\r\nOn the other hand, today, there are more  opportunities available for poor people that could avoid this gap. Several governments around the world are placing many strategies in their social development scheme in order to provide a range of technology for poor people.  For example, because of technology, now,it is possible to install solar panel technology in the most vulnerable regions, which allow poor people to save money. In addition, because of the internet technology, some people with low income can work and study from home in the countryside and rural areas. It allows them to overcome economical hardship and to avoid the gap between them and rich people.\r\n\r\nTo conclude, from my perspective, although there is more technology available for rich people,  technology is also helping poor people significantly. In the future, the government should try to enhance projects where  technology can be directed towards the vulnerable population.\n\nProvide your assessment in the specified JSON format."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"per_criterion\": [{\"name\": \"Task Response\", \"band\": 8.5, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"This essay will discuss these views and will provide my personal opinion of it.\", \"This trend, benefit more often the rich people and leave poor people behind, which in other words creates a gap\", \"technology is also helping poor people significantly.\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"This trend, benefit more often the rich people\", \"type\": \"grammatical error\", \"fix\": \"This trend benefits the rich people more often\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Clarify the conclusion by summarizing the main points discussed in the essay.\", \"Ensure that all sentences are grammatically correct to enhance clarity and coherence.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Coherence & Cohesion\", \"band\": 7.5, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"This essay will discuss these views and will provide my personal opinion of it.\", \"Several governments around the world are placing many strategies in their social development scheme in order to provide a range of technology for poor people.\", \"In addition, because of the internet technology, some people with low income can work and study from home in the countryside and rural areas.\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"This trend, benefit more often the rich people and leave poor people behind, which in other words creates a gap\", \"type\": \"grammatical error\", \"fix\": \"This trend benefits the rich people more often and leaves poor people behind, which in other words creates a gap.\"}, {\"span\": \"now,it is possible to install solar panel technology\", \"type\": \"punctuation error\", \"fix\": \"now, it is possible to install solar panel technology\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Ensure subject-verb agreement is maintained throughout the essay to enhance clarity.\", \"Use appropriate punctuation to separate clauses correctly, improving the flow of sentences.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Lexical Resource\", \"band\": 7.5, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"the latest technology is likely to be expensive\", \"create a gap\", \"overcome economical hardship\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"benefit more often the rich people\", \"type\": \"word choice\", \"fix\": \"benefits the rich more often\"}, {\"span\": \"the most vulnerable regions\", \"type\": \"word choice\", \"fix\": \"the most vulnerable areas\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Use more varied synonyms to avoid repetition, such as using 'wealthy' instead of 'rich'.\", \"Incorporate more complex phrases or idiomatic expressions to enhance the sophistication of the language.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Grammatical Range & Accuracy\", \"band\": 8.5, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"this essay will discuss these views and will provide my personal opinion of it.\", \"there are more opportunities available for poor people that could avoid this gap.\", \"technology is also helping poor people significantly.\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"benefit more often the rich people\", \"type\": \"subject-verb agreement\", \"fix\": \"benefits more often the rich people\"}, {\"span\": \"which allow poor people to save money\", \"type\": \"subject-verb agreement\", \"fix\": \"which allows poor people to save money\"}, {\"span\": \"the government should try to enhance projects where technology can be directed towards the vulnerable population\", \"type\": \"wordiness\", \"fix\": \"the government should enhance projects directing technology towards the vulnerable population\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Ensure subject-verb agreement is maintained throughout the essay.\", \"Consider reducing wordiness for clearer expression of ideas.\", \"Vary sentence structures to further enhance grammatical range.\"]}], \"overall\": 8.0}"}]}

Furthermore,after the children's marriage,they will be separated by them and live the         remaining life lonely.The Asian countries are prime examples, about 80% of the aged populations are tend to live separately.\n\nDespite the above arguments, I am of the view that local governance gives more priority to the aged population. Indeed, one reason why I believe is that the older generation people are mostly retired from their profession and spend rest of life lonely.Additionally, many people do have medical complications as becoming older and older. Consequently, the medicines are quite expensive now a day's which is not affordable for them. To illustrate, the New York Times published an  article about the survival of elders in this contemporary era. As a result, there is a  shortage of monthly income and ministry could lend their hands for them. \n\nIn conclusion, while both views are held in society and I strongly believe that ministry support as much as needed for them.

Although educating the civilizations through the museum is crucial, I believe that these could also be used as a source of entertainment.\n\nAt the outset, one main reason that museums are needed to be used for educational purpose is that these can work as live presentations. As various subjects related to History and Art have been read by people in their schools and institutions, but not every person is capable to remember longer theoretical texts. Thus, by visiting such places the practical aspects of that particular subject have been accomplished and in-depth knowledge can be required. To exemplify, a report produced by the Education Department states that school children who have visited museums can have 60% more grip on the subject of history.\n\nOn the other hand, by making the museums more enjoyable, more benefit could be achieved. Firstly, due to the influence of cinema and theatre, if we can make museums more entertaining, more visitors and tourists can get attracted towards these significant places. So from an economic viewpoint, by charging reasonable fees, this money could be used for the maintenance of ancient artefacts. Secondly, by increasing the number of tourists, museums can bring laurels to the country. The Madame Tussaud, a wax museum, is a good example of this which has brought a sense of pride for London on the world level. Thirdly, the information could be grasped more easily if it is provided enjoyably. Because learners are more open to the facts and hence, from my viewpoint, entertainment is also beneficial in the field of education, if it is used in museums.\n\nIn conclusion, it is a matter of debate that what should be the purpose of museums.

I personally agree partly with this view. \r\n\r\nOn the one hand, one’s life may benefit from the appearance of several multinational organizations. To begin with, a greater number of global companies means people have great chances in order to make a living because there will be a position for them in the company. Besides, one may have to communicate and meet lots of people when working in a global organization, which means they will have a clear opportunity to widen their social circle. Moreover, customers might receive magnificent customer service from many multinational companies. Companies located in countries means they have an enormous number of customers. This means they have to put effort into enhancing their customer service. As a result, one could experience outstanding service from these companies. \r\n\r\nOn the other hand, negative effects could be the result of multinational organizations. Firstly, it is extremely hard for those who want to create their own business because they have to compete with lots of big companies. For example, start-ups in Vietnam have to undergo difficulties because they have to face several big worldwide organizations. Besides, customers often tend to choose well-known companies such as worldwide companies and newly-created companies might not become their option. Secondly, being fluent in several languages could be one of the requirements for those who want to have a job in a multinational company. This means those who are just able to communicate in their mother tongue cannot work for a global company and this may tighten their opportunities in order to get a job. \r\n\r\nIn conclusion, the huge number of global companies results in lots of benefits for people such as creating jobs for them or giving them significant customer assistance.

What are the reasons for this? How can people research this?\n\nScore this IELTS Task 2 essay according to the rubric, ensuring alignment with the question:\n\nIn this day and age, there is a developing trend in many nations, in which people are taking an interest in learning more about the accommodation they live in. The following essay is going to discuss the reasons behind this trend and how people could research it.\r\n\r\nTo begin with, learning about the history of the apartments brings several benefits to the owners such as having a better understanding of the power and water systems of the building. This is a piece of crucial knowledge, especially when the landlords need to conduct any repair or maintenance. For instance, the owners could locate the hidden pipe with ease in order to maintain it, saving them the time and manpower needed to handle the job. Moreover, looking for the past of the accommodations could help buyers avoid purchasing tainted houses. In many cultures, the reputation of the previous owner plays a vital role in the sale of the residence, and if the ex-owner had earned himself a bad name, buyers hardly consider that building a suitable choice. For instance, in Asia, if there was a death happened in the cottage, it is alleged that the customers would not choose to reside inside it for the rest of their lives. \r\n\r\nInvestigating the past of the buildings is quite an easy task, as the information about the dwelling is publicly listed on the Internet. However, the downside of this method is that this data is used to promote the sale, so any adverse features would be hidden or not fully presented, thus the customers could be in a stalemate if they do not carefully examine the house. Another way to gather information about the apartment is by asking the neighbours. These people have spent a long time living in the area, and potentially know every detail about the apartment as well as the previous holder. For example, a man has decided to buy a residence, nevertheless, after hearing the story about a whole family who had been murdered inside the shack by the person who lives over the road, he quickly turns down the offer, therefore dodging a house containing bad luck. \r\n\r\nIn conclusion, investigating the past of the accommodations could benefit the owners physically and spiritually, as they can save time from maintenance and avoid buying tainted houses, and they can gather information about the buildings by asking the neighbourhood and searching on the Internet.\n\nProvide your assessment in the specified JSON format."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"per_criterion\": [{\"name\": \"Task Response\", \"band\": 9.0, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"the following essay is going to discuss the reasons behind this trend and how people could research it.\", \"investigating the past of the accommodations could benefit the owners physically and spiritually, as they can save time from maintenance and avoid buying tainted houses\"], \"errors\": [], \"suggestions\": [\"Ensure that all examples provided are relevant and directly support the main argument.\", \"Consider expanding on the potential negative consequences of not researching the accommodation's history to provide a more balanced view.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Coherence & Cohesion\", \"band\": 8.0, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"the following essay is going to discuss the reasons behind this trend and how people could research it.\", \"investigating the past of the accommodations could benefit the owners physically and spiritually\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"if there was a death happened in the cottage\", \"type\": \"grammatical error\", \"fix\": \"if there had been a death in the cottage\"}, {\"span\": \"the customers could be in a stalemate if they do not carefully examine the house\", \"type\": \"clarity issue\", \"fix\": \"the customers could find themselves in a difficult situation if they do not carefully examine the house\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Use more varied linking words to enhance the flow between ideas.\", \"Ensure grammatical accuracy to maintain clarity in complex sentences.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Lexical Resource\", \"band\": 8.0, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"learning about the history of the apartments brings several benefits to the owners\", \"the reputation of the previous owner plays a vital role in the sale of the residence\", \"investigating the past of the accommodations could benefit the owners physically and spiritually\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"if there was a death happened in the cottage\", \"type\": \"grammatical error\", \"fix\": \"if there was a death that happened in the cottage\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Consider using more varied synonyms to avoid repetition, such as using 'residential properties' instead of 'accommodations'.\", \"Enhance the essay by incorporating more advanced vocabulary related to real estate and property history.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Grammatical Range & Accuracy\", \"band\": 9.0, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"the owners could locate the hidden pipe with ease in order to maintain it, saving them the time and manpower needed to handle the job.\", \"the reputation of the previous owner plays a vital role in the sale of the residence\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"if there was a death happened in the cottage\", \"type\": \"tense error\", \"fix\": \"if there was a death that happened in the cottage\"}, {\"span\": \"the customers could be in a stalemate\", \"type\": \"word choice error\", \"fix\": \"the customers could find themselves in a stalemate\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Ensure proper use of tense and structure in conditional sentences.\", \"Use more precise vocabulary to convey meaning clearly.\"]}], \"overall\": 8.5}"}]}

Discuss both these views and give your own opinion.\n\nScore this IELTS Task 2 essay according to the rubric, ensuring alignment with the question:\n\nIt is considered by many that people should do their best to lessen global warming’s effects, but others believe that we should get used to living with it. I think, despite  being the irreversible effects that global change brings about, we exactly seek to solve this problem rather than accepting.\r\n\r\nFirst, without taking precautions, the condition of the world can become  worse or deteriorate by only learning how to live with climate change. Therefore, we should make people more conscious of its effect and take some measures to mitigate it. For example, government and conservation organizations promote people to get about using biodegradable materials instead of using disposable ones such as plastics. Hence, we might contribute to this change positively to be a reversible effect. \r\n\r\nHowever, many scholars think that this situation becomes an irreversible matter, which does not help people to stop this change. So, ones which encounter problems related to climate change must get used to situations, resulting in decreasing its harm and damage and thus saving people’s lives. For instance, in northern Turkey because of global change towns flood with heavy rain and landscapes occur more often compared to the past. Consequently, inhabitants readjust to new conditions by changing town plans or the location of their houses.\r\n\r\nIn my opinion, although climate change’s effects are rising day by day, this problem only solves by humans. Nevertheless, it comes out with human’s mistakes, it will simply be sorted out by people. If the government and all people cooperate with each other and people are educated about its adverse effects, I think we cope with that situation.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, even if people prefer to spend their time getting used to the world’s extraordinary conditions, they must tend to be cared to stop these conditions by being increased their awareness.\n\nProvide your assessment in the specified JSON format."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"per_criterion\": [{\"name\": \"Task Response\", \"band\": 7.5, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"we should make people more conscious of its effect and take some measures to mitigate it.\", \"this problem only solves by humans.\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"despite being the irreversible effects that global change brings about\", \"type\": \"clarity and coherence\", \"fix\": \"rephrase to clarify the intended meaning, e.g., 'despite the irreversible effects that global change brings about'\"}, {\"span\": \"tend to be cared to stop these conditions by being increased their awareness\", \"type\": \"grammar and clarity\", \"fix\": \"rephrase for clarity, e.g., 'need to be cared for to stop these conditions by increasing their awareness'\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Clarify complex phrases to enhance coherence and understanding.\", \"Ensure grammatical accuracy to improve the overall quality of the argument.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Coherence & Cohesion\", \"band\": 6.5, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"we should make people more conscious of its effect and take some measures to mitigate it\", \"this problem only solves by humans\", \"they must tend to be cared to stop these conditions by being increased their awareness\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"this problem only solves by humans\", \"type\": \"grammatical error affecting clarity\", \"fix\": \"this problem can only be solved by humans\"}, {\"span\": \"by being increased their awareness\", \"type\": \"awkward phrasing affecting coherence\", \"fix\": \"by increasing their awareness\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Use clearer and more precise language to enhance understanding.\", \"Ensure that each paragraph has a clear topic sentence to guide the reader.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Lexical Resource\", \"band\": 6.5, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"lessen global warming’s effects\", \"make people more conscious of its effect\", \"tend to be cared to stop these conditions\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"the irreversible effects that global change brings about\", \"type\": \"word choice\", \"fix\": \"the irreversible effects that global change causes\"}, {\"span\": \"this problem only solves by humans\", \"type\": \"grammar\", \"fix\": \"this problem can only be solved by humans\"}, {\"span\": \"by being increased their awareness\", \"type\": \"word order\", \"fix\": \"by increasing their awareness\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Use more varied vocabulary to express ideas, such as synonyms for 'effects' or 'change'.\", \"Pay attention to grammatical structures, particularly passive voice and subject-verb agreement.\", \"Improve clarity by restructuring awkward phrases to enhance readability.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Grammatical Range & Accuracy\", \"band\": 7.5, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"we should make people more conscious of its effect and take some measures to mitigate it.\", \"this problem only solves by humans.\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"being the irreversible effects that global change brings about\", \"type\": \"word form\", \"fix\": \"the irreversible effects that global change brings about are undeniable\"}, {\"span\": \"ones which encounter problems related to climate change must get used to situations\", \"type\": \"word choice\", \"fix\": \"those who encounter problems related to climate change must get used to the situation\"}, {\"span\": \"by being increased their awareness\", \"type\": \"word order\", \"fix\": \"by increasing their awareness\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Use more varied sentence structures to enhance complexity.\", \"Ensure subject-verb agreement and correct word forms throughout the essay.\", \"Clarify ambiguous phrases to improve overall coherence.\"]}], \"overall\": 7.0}"}]}

Robotics is now a field that is not unknown and the spike, we are seeing in its implementation is something huge. Today, robots are present everywhere whether it is at home as your cleaner and vacuum or in the operation theatre as surgeons' assistants. However, the opinions on it are quite the opposite. Some believe that it is the best invention in the history of mankind while some believe otherwise. I opine that its benefits are weighed higher on the scale as compared to its drawbacks\r\n\r\nTo begin with, robots have taken the world by storm through the outcome and  their performance. The first and foremost advantage is it has never been so easy to solve complex problems as it is today. robots have the innate ability to do various tasks together and to provide accurate answers. Secondly, they are now sharing the workload of human beings by performing various levels of  work thus providing them with  a sense of relaxation. For instance, many surgeries are now performed by Da Vinci which is a specialized robot to assist surgeons and in this way, half of the burden has been reduced.\r\n\r\nOn the other side, there are drawbacks that should be taken into consideration. One of them is the industry will soon be converted into an AI-driven workforce and as a ,result millions of people will be jobless as e!employers will prefer this one-time investment instead of paying an amount every month to the employee. Another thing that is alarming is the lack of power to change decisions timely. These electronics work on the installed and manufactured intelligence therefore they do not have the capability to switch their mode according to circumstances. For example, if a robot is teaching a class that is not disciplined, it has no power to process how to keep children motivated.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, I would like to say that in spite of a few deficiencies, it is going to help human beings in great ways in the near future .

Some people believe seeking employment after school can also be successful in their careers. From my perspective, I believe both methods for a successful career could be achieved, because it is related to two main aspects: job properties and required skills.\n\n \n\nFirstly, I strongly believe that, sophisticated majors are required a wide range of theories and knowledge to support further academic research such as mathematics, physics, and chemistry. Those research are highly complicated and complex  working with a team and guided by professors is essential. University and college are able to educate the potential student to equip them with the required knowledge and logical framework and offer a chance to participate in those academic research projects working with talented people to achieve their first step toward success. However, many research projects also required a solid foundation in previous education such as Master or Doctor learning experience which is highly restricted for a person who only graduate from high school or bachelor degree. Moreover, the research perspective such as Cyber Security and Artificial Intelligence needs more than a single area of knowledge but working interdisciplinary with math and computer science. Therefore, It is research properties and skills limit candidates educational background.\n\n \n\nSecondly, I also believe that skill-oriented occupations rely on job experience more than the knowledge from schools such as chief, waiter and sales. The school could teach basic operations and theories for students, but the experience is hardly gained from school. During employment, they are able to master the skill which learns from school and development their own methods after many failers. As a result, those mastered skills could help them establish business and make a huge fortune. So getting a job straight after  school could be another method to achieve success in a career.\n\n \n\nIn summary, Job properties and skill requirements limit people occupation choices and career paths.

While some people argue that advertising can boost the economy, others claim that it may bring undesirable social effects. As far as I am concerned, advertising may bring more positive effects to the general public. In this essay, I will outline both sides and elaborate on my view. \r\n\r\nTo begin with, it is widely believed that advertising encourages more purchasing. As advertisements allow sellers to outline the specialist of their products, people may be attracted by their functions and have a trial of the new products. For example, a large number of people are buying Apple watch after they saw the advertisement. Therefore, the economy may be raised owing to the increasing amount of purchasing.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, advertising may result in a sense of dissatisfaction. As firms need to publish different products to keep innovation, it may be difficult for consumers to purchase all the latest products. For instance, brands may publish new bags seasonally in order to compete with each other. Therefore, if people see the advertisement of new products, they may be dissatisfied with their own goods and consider others are better. \r\n\r\nIn conclusion, although some people may be dissatisfied with what they have once they think the new products are better than theirs, it is undeniable that advertising can attract more consumer attention as well as ensure purchasing.

Thence, some people contemplate that increasing the price of fuels such as coal, gas, gasoline for cars and other vehicles is one of the best solution. In my opinion, it may be  the right way, however, this is not the only solution to tackle this problem. \r\n\r\nTo begin with, increasing the pay of crude oil can help to some degree, but there is more disadvantage.

Some people think that only government action can solve this problem. To what extent do you agree or disagree?\n\nScore this IELTS Task 2 essay according to the rubric, ensuring alignment with the question:\n\nIn metropolitan cities, the shortage of accommodation is turning into a severe burden for citizens and some are of the opinion that this issue can be tackled solely by the actions of a government. I completely agree with this argument and I will fortify my view in the following paragraphs. \n\nOne reason why I believe the government can deal with this problem is that it holds the right to imply new rules and policies and there are some sounding rules which would be logical to introduce. For example, if they apply a rule regarding the encouragement of the construction of high-rise buildings and prohibition of the old landed houses, more people can dwell in flats and this results in a considerable amount of land saving. In contrast, if the authority would not take such a precaution, there wouldn't be enough space for the forthcoming citizens. \n\nAnother outstanding solution would be enticing people, who live in the rural areas, away from migrating to big cities. In order to maintain this, power owners should convince or force factories and companies in relocating their businesses to these outskirts.

This is called \"peer pressure\". Do the disadvantages of peer pressure outweigh the advantages.\n\nScore this IELTS Task 2 essay according to the rubric, ensuring alignment with the question:\n\nIn  contemporary society, young individuals who have been subject to peer pressure may have begun to demonstrate emotional and behavioural changes. While this type of pressure can help teens consolidate their behaviour and their performance in the classroom, I assume that it can also have an adverse bearing on their mental health.\r\n\r\nIt is undeniable that through regular interaction with constructive examples and perspectives of peers, who are in a similar age group or social status, the primary benefit for young students is the possibility of forming and maintaining frequent academic practices. Those adolescents tend to take others, especially those with whom they have admiration, as role models. Consequently, the presence of positive role models boosts the likelihood of academic and even social achievement among young pupils. For example, observing a peer’s success in a prestigious intellectual competition, such as Road to Mount Olympia - a well-known competition for outstanding students to showcase their intelligence - can motivate other students to study industriously and enhance their performance at school.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, I believe that the adverse effects of peer pressure  on an individual's mental well-being overshadow its benefits. It is worth noting that this tendency can increase stress levels in the young, which in turn can make them feel inadequate or become reticent when expressing their opinions and personal ideas.

Some people argue that the government have to focus on spending more money on fixing social problems such as housing shortage, whereas others insist that the solution is nothing to do with the government. The aim of this essay is to explore both opinions and elucidate my view in the following paragraphs. \r\n\r\nFirst of all, the purpose of the existence of government is to protect and provide a safe and clean environment. However, due to alarming levels of pollution, people are suffering from a lot of illnesses such as respiratory and cardiovascular diseases. Besides, as many people are living in unhygienic conditions, they are exposed to infectious diseases. It is not easy to eradicate all these illnesses as a huge amount of money and specialists are needed. This is the reason why the government and official institutes should pay more attention to our living conditions and provide proper solutions. \r\n\r\nOn the other hand, there are limitations of government provision and intervention, therefore each of us has to make efforts as much as possible. For example, the crucial reason for pollution is not because of the government's policy but of our behaviour of wasting habits. Thus, the essential solution is that we have to change our lifestyles such as using public transportation, carrying our own mugs and not utilizing disposable containers etc. Besides, we all have to clean our houses so that we can keep away from germs and it will lead to making ourselves healthy. \r\n\r\nTo sum up, we are facing very miserable situations due to  environmental destruction and poor housing conditions.

Moreover, the advent of the ubiquitous internet era and portable devices such as smartphones has had an exponential effect on attention spans and diversionary priorities. Most students today are addicted to short videos and posts on social media networks and therefore struggle to follow the intricate arguments of lengthy lectures and extended readings.\r\n\r\nOn a small scale, individuals can remedy these problems through sheer willpower but for broader change schools must play an active role. The most immediate fix would be to ban phones. This is difficult since phones serve practical purposes such as allowing students to call their parents or book a ride home, but they could be taken at the beginning of the day and returned when school finishes. Another step schools could take would be to modernise the curriculum and account for reduced attention spans. Lessons could be shorter and could include more interactivity in order to stimulate learning. rather than the passive learning environment that has led to daydreaming students for generations.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, although this trend is likely an irreversible part of human nature and progress, schools can implement changes. to curb its effects.

As this needs imperative attention, I think it shall take a while for this concern to be addressed.\n\nMarked by their elusive beauties, celebrities hail in all forms of media; thus, people only see their outer sophistication. Nonetheless, their achievements are commonly left unnoticed. This is mainly due to idolatry where beauty is considered an investment.

For instance, adverts hire celebrities whose commanding influence hypnotises others to follow.

Safety and interest are considered the main reasons for this trend.\r\n\r\nImproved living standard has led humans to be more conscious about their lives in general, safety in particular. Like food intake and healthcare, they care about their accommodation. To be more specific, they are curious if their buildings are well constructed or not or when they were built. It is no exaggeration to say that a rundown apartment being built 50 years ago is not a preferable choice. By researching the house or the flat they are living, people likely are able to reduce the risks of unsafety. Another reason is perhaps their hobby. Living in fast-paced life with a myriad of stress, taking up a hobby is not a bad way. In this case, what these people are doing is somehow like an explorer discovering the past and this brings them contentment and joyness.\r\n\r\nTo know about the past of a building or an apartment, asking nearby neighbours, not least the elderly may be the most feasible method.

These are obviously invaluable clues for them to find out more about the building's past. \r\n\r\nIn conclusion, it seems to me that more people become more enthusiastic to study about their house's history because of their own safety and interests.

Machinesmachines help people prepare food in artistic and creative ways  since the effort is lessened. In baking, for instance, years before many people have to spend vigorous strength on making icing and experience a tremendous amount of time in the kitchen for a layered cake.

Hence, not all the time people have access to electricity which are the primary component of effective working machines. Although, it is unlikely to occur in the future as long as people are capable of procuring those machines and electric access. \r\n\r\nIn conclusion, It is certain that machine has a negative effect as this promote dependence which leads to an individual ignorance of basic skills.

I am inclined to believe that the positive aspects of this matter prevail over the negative ones. In this essay I shall delve into this issue by revealing the culprits behind it and identifying not only the disadvantages but also the advantages of it, before concluding on my opinion.\nLooking at this phenomenon from an economic point of view, we can say that nowadays people tend to postpone having children due to an increased focus in their career. In other words, most people have been studying for many years and they feel that they need to prove themselves professionally by building a successful career before having a family. Another logical reason for the occurrence of this issue is also that most people these days want to have children after being financially stable and feeling mature enough to raise a child. It is true that being a parent is one of the most significant responsibilities that somebody can take through their life, thus you have to be prepared for it.\n\nOne of the most beneficial aspects adding to the support of this issue is that it lets people to live their life to their fullest potential before becoming parents. To put it more simply, the older you decide to have children, the more time you will have to educate yourself and find what makes you really a happy individual. This will result not only in a more fulfilling life and an inner satisfaction but will also create the foundations for a happy family.\nContinuing with the drawbacks, it would be an omission not to emphasize that the older somebody gets the most difficult is to have children. To put it more simply, scientific evidence suggests that the probability of having a child is getting smaller, specially after becoming 40, and that is why many people seek medical advice when they are facing this problem. With the combination of high infertility rates in many countries, giving birth to a child after a certain age seems to be a really challenging issue.\nTo conclude, the causes of this phenomenon are quite evident as they seem to appear all over us and in my opinion the benefits of creating a family in a later stage of your life outweigh the drawbacks.\n\nProvide your assessment in the specified JSON format."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"per_criterion\": [{\"name\": \"Task Response\", \"band\": 6.0, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"the positive aspects of this matter prevail over the negative ones\", \"the benefits of creating a family in a later stage of your life outweigh the drawbacks\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"the older somebody gets the most difficult is to have children\", \"type\": \"clarity\", \"fix\": \"the older somebody gets, the more difficult it is to have children\"}, {\"span\": \"lets people to live their life to their fullest potential\", \"type\": \"grammar\", \"fix\": \"lets people live their life to their fullest potential\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Provide more specific examples or evidence to support the claims made about the advantages and disadvantages.\", \"Clarify the structure of the essay by clearly separating the discussion of advantages and disadvantages into distinct paragraphs.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Coherence & Cohesion\", \"band\": 5.0, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"the positive aspects of this matter prevail over the negative ones\", \"the older you decide to have children, the more time you will have to educate yourself\", \"the benefits of creating a family in a later stage of your life outweigh the drawbacks\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"the most difficult is to have children\", \"type\": \"grammatical error\", \"fix\": \"the most difficult it is to have children\"}, {\"span\": \"the probability of having a child is getting smaller, specially after becoming 40\", \"type\": \"word choice error\", \"fix\": \"especially after turning 40\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Use clearer transitions between paragraphs to enhance the flow of ideas.\", \"Ensure that all comparative statements are grammatically correct to improve clarity.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Lexical Resource\", \"band\": 5.0, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"the positive aspects of this matter prevail over the negative ones\", \"the older you decide to have children, the more time you will have to educate yourself\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"lets people to live their life to their fullest potential\", \"type\": \"preposition error\", \"fix\": \"lets people live their life to their fullest potential\"}, {\"span\": \"the most difficult is to have children\", \"type\": \"grammatical error\", \"fix\": \"the more difficult it is to have children\"}, {\"span\": \"specially after becoming 40\", \"type\": \"lexical error\", \"fix\": \"especially after becoming 40\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Use a wider range of vocabulary to express ideas more precisely and avoid repetition.\", \"Pay attention to grammatical structures, particularly with comparative forms and prepositions.\", \"Proofread for common lexical errors, such as 'specially' instead of 'especially'.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Grammatical Range & Accuracy\", \"band\": 6.0, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"the positive aspects of this matter prevail over the negative ones\", \"the older you decide to have children, the more time you will have to educate yourself\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"lets people to live their life to their fullest potential\", \"type\": \"incorrect verb form\", \"fix\": \"lets people live their life to their fullest potential\"}, {\"span\": \"the older somebody gets the most difficult is to have children\", \"type\": \"incorrect word order\", \"fix\": \"the older somebody gets, the more difficult it is to have children\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Vary sentence structures by incorporating more complex sentences to enhance grammatical range.\", \"Pay attention to word order and verb forms to improve accuracy in sentence construction.\"]}], \"overall\": 5.5}"}]}

Although this issue may cause some drawbacks, I personally think it is more beneficial for husbands and wives to become parents when they are more mature and get ready.\r\n\r\nOn the one hand, it is evident that having children early could reduce some worries about the low rate of prenancy and the health of mothers and babies when women get older. Numerous scientists have proven that the older we become, the more difficult we have babies, especially females over thirty years old. Moreover, there is a high percentage of infants born with disabled diseases after delivery if mothers are over thirty-five years old. Therefore, many people advocate that the ideal range of ages to be pregnant is between twenty-five and thirty which would protect women from some advert events while delivering. These things might be main causes leading many families to have children when they are still young.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, I strongly believe that a couple should have kids when they have enough financial conditions and mental health inspite of getting older. We cannot deny the importance of incomes and savings before having a new member in our family. If a couple has no stable jobs or very low-salaries, they should spend time developing their career and earning more money before becoming parents. Moreover, many persons do not prepare their spirits and consider how the life will change after a baby come which make them  confused, depressed and could not control themselves when their babies are born. As a result, the most important thing when we commit to have children is not our ages, but a sufficient preparation for everything.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, despite some huge benefits of having babies early, it seems to me that we should prepare enough personal budgets and mental strength before welcoming our children.\n\nProvide your assessment in the specified JSON format."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"per_criterion\": [{\"name\": \"Task Response\", \"band\": 6.0, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"I personally think it is more beneficial for husbands and wives to become parents when they are more mature and get ready.\", \"the most important thing when we commit to have children is not our ages, but a sufficient preparation for everything.\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"the ideal range of ages to be pregnant is between twenty-five and thirty\", \"type\": \"lack of clarity\", \"fix\": \"clarify that this is a suggestion rather than a definitive ideal\"}, {\"span\": \"having children early could reduce some worries about the low rate of prenancy\", \"type\": \"factual inaccuracy\", \"fix\": \"correct 'prenancy' to 'pregnancy' and clarify the relationship between early childbirth and pregnancy rates\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Provide more balanced arguments by discussing both benefits and drawbacks of having children at different ages.\", \"Use clearer language to express ideas, ensuring that the reader understands the implications of the arguments presented.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Coherence & Cohesion\", \"band\": 5.0, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"I personally think it is more beneficial for husbands and wives to become parents when they are more mature and get ready.\", \"the most important thing when we commit to have children is not our ages, but a sufficient preparation for everything.\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"the ideal range of ages to be pregnant is between twenty-five and thirty which would protect women from some advert events while delivering.\", \"type\": \"sentence structure\", \"fix\": \"Add a comma before 'which' to clarify the sentence.\"}, {\"span\": \"many persons do not prepare their spirits and consider how the life will change after a baby come which make them confused, depressed and could not control themselves when their babies are born.\", \"type\": \"subject-verb agreement\", \"fix\": \"Change 'make' to 'makes' to agree with 'which'.\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Use clearer transitions between ideas to enhance the flow of the essay.\", \"Ensure subject-verb agreement throughout the essay to improve grammatical accuracy.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Lexical Resource\", \"band\": 5.0, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"having children early could reduce some worries about the low rate of prenancy and the health of mothers and babies\", \"the ideal range of ages to be pregnant is between twenty-five and thirty\", \"we should prepare enough personal budgets and mental strength before welcoming our children\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"low rate of prenancy\", \"type\": \"spelling error\", \"fix\": \"low rate of pregnancy\"}, {\"span\": \"disabled diseases\", \"type\": \"inappropriate word choice\", \"fix\": \"disabilities\"}, {\"span\": \"inspite of getting older\", \"type\": \"phrase error\", \"fix\": \"in spite of getting older\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Use a wider range of vocabulary to express ideas more precisely.\", \"Pay attention to spelling and grammatical accuracy to enhance clarity.\", \"Avoid repetition of phrases and consider using synonyms to improve lexical variety.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Grammatical Range & Accuracy\", \"band\": 6.0, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"it is evident that having children early could reduce some worries about the low rate of prenancy and the health of mothers and babies when women get older.\", \"we cannot deny the importance of incomes and savings before having a new member in our family.\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"low rate of prenancy\", \"type\": \"spelling error\", \"fix\": \"low rate of pregnancy\"}, {\"span\": \"inspite of getting older\", \"type\": \"phrase error\", \"fix\": \"in spite of getting older\"}, {\"span\": \"how the life will change after a baby come\", \"type\": \"subject-verb agreement error\", \"fix\": \"how life will change after a baby comes\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Proofread the essay to correct spelling errors such as 'prenancy' to 'pregnancy'.\", \"Use the correct phrase 'in spite of' instead of 'inspite of'.\", \"Ensure subject-verb agreement by changing 'a baby come' to 'a baby comes'.\"]}], \"overall\": 5.5}"}]}

A segment of society believes that robots play a vital role in an individual’s future growth. On the other hand, a few expect that machines are harmful creations that can affect  mankind. In my opinion, robots are truly essential and are time-saving. However, their development may lead to unemployment.\r\n\r\nTo begin with, machines have multiple merits. First and  foremost is that they can do any difficult task so efficiently which humans cannot do easily. Secondly, machines are time-saving. To elaborate, an individual may take a longer time to complete a task but machines can finish work on or before time as they have in-build software. One can easily leave time constraints behind. For instance, a survey conducted by Harvard University in 2019 showed that to build a house, robots completed it 50% more timely than humans. So, with the help of ,machines people can work efficiently thus can save time altogether.\r\n\r\nIn contrary to the above notion, a few people disagree with the statement. The reason being, primarily, machines are emotionless and lack  empathy. Apart from this, machines development may lead to unemployment. To explicate, if machines will be doing everything then there will not be further need of labour. Thus, there will be fewer jobs in the market. To exemplify, an article written by a famous researcher in “The Times” last month specified that unemployment is rapidly increasing by 10% every quarter in most of the countries. So, it's evident that evolution has a negative side as well.\r\n\r\nIn my opinion, from the above discourse, it can be construed that although robots have a negative effect on  society in spite, they are more helpful in the development of the nation.\n\nProvide your assessment in the specified JSON format."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"per_criterion\": [{\"name\": \"Task Response\", \"band\": 8.0, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"robots are truly essential and are time-saving\", \"machines have multiple merits\", \"although robots have a negative effect on society in spite, they are more helpful in the development of the nation\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"machines development may lead to unemployment\", \"type\": \"grammatical error\", \"fix\": \"the development of machines may lead to unemployment\"}, {\"span\": \"in contrary to the above notion\", \"type\": \"phrase usage error\", \"fix\": \"in contrast to the above notion\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Provide more specific examples to support claims about the benefits and drawbacks of robots.\", \"Clarify the conclusion to better reflect the complexities of the argument presented.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Coherence & Cohesion\", \"band\": 7.0, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"machines have multiple merits.\", \"robots completed it 50% more timely than humans.\", \"although robots have a negative effect on society in spite, they are more helpful in the development of the nation.\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"in contrary to the above notion\", \"type\": \"phrase usage\", \"fix\": \"instead of 'in contrary to', use 'contrary to'.\"}, {\"span\": \"with the help of ,machines\", \"type\": \"punctuation error\", \"fix\": \"remove the space before the comma.\"}, {\"span\": \"in spite, they are more helpful\", \"type\": \"phrase structure\", \"fix\": \"replace 'in spite' with 'in spite of this'.\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Use clearer transition phrases to enhance the flow between contrasting ideas.\", \"Ensure proper punctuation and spacing to maintain clarity.\", \"Rephrase complex sentences for better readability and coherence.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Lexical Resource\", \"band\": 7.0, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"machines are time-saving\", \"machines have multiple merits\", \"machines are emotionless and lack empathy\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"in contrary to the above notion\", \"type\": \"collocation\", \"fix\": \"contrary to the above notion\"}, {\"span\": \"in-build software\", \"type\": \"word choice\", \"fix\": \"built-in software\"}, {\"span\": \"in spite, they are more helpful\", \"type\": \"grammar\", \"fix\": \"in spite of this, they are more helpful\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Use more varied vocabulary to express ideas, such as synonyms for 'machines' or 'robots'.\", \"Ensure correct collocations and phrases, such as 'contrary to' instead of 'in contrary to'.\", \"Pay attention to grammatical structures, particularly prepositions and conjunctions, to enhance clarity.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Grammatical Range & Accuracy\", \"band\": 8.0, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"machines have multiple merits.\", \"robots completed it 50% more timely than humans.\", \"machines are emotionless and lack empathy.\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"in-build software\", \"type\": \"word choice\", \"fix\": \"in-built software\"}, {\"span\": \"In contrary to the above notion\", \"type\": \"preposition usage\", \"fix\": \"Contrary to the above notion\"}, {\"span\": \"in spite, they are more helpful\", \"type\": \"phrase structure\", \"fix\": \"in spite of this, they are more helpful\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Use more varied sentence structures to enhance complexity.\", \"Ensure consistent use of prepositions and phrases for clarity.\", \"Consider using more advanced vocabulary to express ideas more precisely.\"]}], \"overall\": 7.5}"}]}

What are the reasons for this? How can people research this?\n\nScore this IELTS Task 2 essay according to the rubric, ensuring alignment with the question:\n\nPresently, people who live in some nations have a tendency to observe the narrative of their house or accommodation. This article will elaborate on the reasons for this trend and the best approach to do research on this issue.\r\n\r\nTo begin with, the main reasons why some are curious about the story of their accommodation are for  economic purposes and to understand their ancestors for their identity matters. For the first reason, it is clear that individuals who have old buildings which contain historical values will benefit  financially. This means that they can sell their belonging to collectors or simply build them as historical sites and promotes them to attract visitors. Another reason is  to understand their founding fathers. By knowing it, people may build a sense of identity ,particularly  individuals who live in multicultural cities such as London and New York. Moreover, they can give this valuable information to their children that their cultural backgrounds even races are rooted in Africa or Asian regions such as China and Southeast Asian countries. \r\n\r\nIn order to reach reliable information about the historical aspect of their residence, one of the best methods is an interview. In means that they can acquire data from neighbours who may live for a long time in the area where they live in. For instance, they can prepare a questionnaire for elderly citizens who know well about the story behind the residence in its surrounding. In addition, they can add  gathering data from local history museums or from  old documents that are usually located in local or even national libraries. Therefore, by doing this research they can collect  trustworthy data from reliable sources.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, understanding the house's narrative has a significant role in their life. Although there are multiple reasons to do this, economic reason and identity objectives are the main objectives behind this phenomenon.

In my opinion, although the state should be the primary actor, individuals can also offer aid.\r\n\r\nOn the one hand, only politics have the authority to enact truly large-scale change. authority by design makes decisions for the benefit of the entire citizenry. An example of how this could relate to housing issues would be the urban planning in New York City over the last century. The authorities there had to contend with an unprecedented population surge in a limited urban area. They responded by building skyscrapers that could house many residents, expanding public transport, and constructing various highways to allow commuters to live nearby the city. These solutions could only have been successfully undertaken at the behest of the government.\r\n\r\nHowever, though the role of individuals is less prominent, it still exists. In the previous example, voters in New York City were able to make their voices heard by voting for mayors and governors that best served them. In the event that the government is not addressing housing problems sufficiently, then citizens can write to their representatives, organize protests, or take more drastic action such as relocating to a new city. In the era of social media, it is now more possible than ever before for the average person to openly discuss these issues. Individuals will always find methods to pressure governments, including in areas related to housing.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, I disagree with those who contend only government action can improve housing issues in major metropolitan areas as individuals can collectively always engender some degree of reform.

There are two points of view regarding the best way to have a successful career. Some believe that higher education is the best way while others think experience has a bigger effect. Since both views have valid arguments, it can be ignorant if one of them gets dismissed and because of that, this essay will discuss both.\n\nEducation and experience are two critical factors for a good career. Higher education will help students to learn fundamental science for a job and use them as a source for doing their job. For example, a mechanical engineer learns how a machine works and that knowledge will give him or her the ability to fix them. Although an experienced mechanic can fix machines as well, in case of new and unknown problems, educated mechanics can provide a solution, not experienced ones. On the other hand, studying in college or university will provide a lot of job opportunities for students since a lot of employers demand university degrees these days.\n\nHowever, going to work without higher education can have benefits. Lots of students study majors at university that they will not pursue as a career. So if students get a job right after high school, it will help them to focus on a career and don't waste time. Plus, with more experience than other people their age, they can apply for higher positions at a younger age.\n\nTo sum up, having a successful career is most people's goal and there are two ways to achieve that.

There are a number of causes of this and the problem can be resolved by several solutions.\n\nIt is undeniable that some reasons of the production of goods have much discussed. The most obvious evidence is that factories discharge sewage into the ocean and exhaust fumes in the air. In fact, the processes of making goods need to release waste materials; therefore, these waste materials exert adverse effects on the nature. Furthermore, the appearance of factories and companies decrease the nature lands, including forests or villages. For example, in a rural area of Vietnam, a large number of trees demolished in a forest is to erect factories with the aim of producing iron, which is used for manufacturing cars. Hence, citizens in there will lose an amount of Oxy from the trees.\n\nThere are a number of solutions to reduce the detrimental impacts. First, governments should impose strict laws related to the discharge of waste to manufacturers. If the amount of waste and exhaust fumes is higher than regulatory amount, the factories or companies have to be punished. This leads to that the governments may control the waste and minimize the pollution. Second, governments can request and encourage factories and the inhabitants grow plants. The factories need to grow an equal number of trees that they damaged at another place. As a result, it can be balanced for the number of trees.\n\nIn conclusion, the issue is derived from some causes, and a number of solutions can minimize the negative effects on the environment.\n\nProvide your assessment in the specified JSON format."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"per_criterion\": [{\"name\": \"Task Response\", \"band\": 8.0, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"the environment is becoming more polluted because one of the reasons is that the growth in making customer products.\", \"governments should impose strict laws related to the discharge of waste to manufacturers.\", \"a number of solutions can minimize the negative effects on the environment.\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"the growth in making customer products\", \"type\": \"clarity\", \"fix\": \"the growth in manufacturing consumer products\"}, {\"span\": \"the appearance of factories and companies decrease the nature lands\", \"type\": \"grammar\", \"fix\": \"the appearance of factories and companies decreases natural land\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Clarify the introduction by specifying the main causes and solutions to pollution.\", \"Provide more specific examples of how the proposed solutions can be implemented.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Coherence & Cohesion\", \"band\": 7.0, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"the environment is becoming more polluted because one of the reasons is that the growth in making customer products.\", \"governments should impose strict laws related to the discharge of waste to manufacturers.\", \"the issue is derived from some causes, and a number of solutions can minimize the negative effects on the environment.\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"the growth in making customer products\", \"type\": \"word choice\", \"fix\": \"the growth in manufacturing consumer products\"}, {\"span\": \"the appearance of factories and companies decrease the nature lands\", \"type\": \"subject-verb agreement\", \"fix\": \"the appearance of factories and companies decreases the natural lands\"}, {\"span\": \"citizens in there will lose an amount of Oxy from the trees\", \"type\": \"word choice\", \"fix\": \"citizens there will lose a significant amount of oxygen from the trees\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Use clearer and more precise language to improve clarity, such as replacing 'customer products' with 'consumer products'.\", \"Ensure subject-verb agreement is maintained throughout the essay.\", \"Enhance the logical flow between sentences and paragraphs by using more cohesive devices, such as linking words and phrases.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Lexical Resource\", \"band\": 7.0, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"the environment is becoming more polluted\", \"the processes of making goods need to release waste materials\", \"governments should impose strict laws related to the discharge of waste\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"the growth in making customer products\", \"type\": \"word choice\", \"fix\": \"the growth in producing consumer products\"}, {\"span\": \"decrease the nature lands\", \"type\": \"word choice\", \"fix\": \"decrease natural land\"}, {\"span\": \"in there will lose an amount of Oxy\", \"type\": \"word choice\", \"fix\": \"there will lose a significant amount of oxygen\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Use more precise vocabulary to enhance clarity, such as replacing 'customer products' with 'consumer products'.\", \"Avoid vague phrases like 'the nature' and instead use 'natural environment' or 'natural resources'.\", \"Ensure correct terminology is used, such as 'oxygen' instead of 'Oxy' for formal writing.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Grammatical Range & Accuracy\", \"band\": 8.0, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"the environment is becoming more polluted because one of the reasons is that the growth in making customer products.\", \"governments should impose strict laws related to the discharge of waste to manufacturers.\", \"the factories need to grow an equal number of trees that they damaged at another place.\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"some reasons of the production of goods have much discussed\", \"type\": \"subject-verb agreement\", \"fix\": \"some reasons for the production of goods have been much discussed\"}, {\"span\": \"the appearance of factories and companies decrease the nature lands\", \"type\": \"subject-verb agreement\", \"fix\": \"the appearance of factories and companies decreases the natural lands\"}, {\"span\": \"citizens in there will lose an amount of Oxy from the trees\", \"type\": \"word choice\", \"fix\": \"citizens there will lose a significant amount of oxygen from the trees\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Use more varied sentence structures to enhance complexity.\", \"Ensure subject-verb agreement is maintained throughout the essay.\", \"Choose more precise vocabulary to improve clarity and accuracy.\"]}], \"overall\": 7.5}"}]}

In that face to face interaction is the prime site for an employee hiring. Although, it is considered by few that interview is not an appropriate way of filling the vacancy and there are more reliable sources. However, I mostly disagree with the view. My point  is justified further.\n\nIf it was easy to crack an interview of reputed establishments, then everyone might had got a place in each corporation. Moreover, it is not a piece of cake for all, it needs courage, dedication along with proper knowledge because all true colours flow out in front of interviewers. One of the many criteria judged is, crammed theory. For example, when a person is given a complicated situation and asked how will they put their learning into an action. Such is the time when the stars start surrounding around the head, because all they remember is what the theory says, but do not know the real life application of that intelligence. Thus, the individual gets rejected as they do not need a book, but a human engine to run their machines. Furthermore, other criteria to qualify is, communication skills. For example, if a product is needed to be sold, then the buyers should be provided with as best offer as possible, just for company profit. Whatever, the business it is running, the best way to buy or sell products is negotiation with the way of talking and persuading them with some schemes. In addition, introsceptiner also notes the practical exposure and change of facial express. For example, expressions like lies, fear, worry, anxiety and the capability of a man.\n\n The capability of a person is also judged by his past interest and achievements until now.\n\nOn the contrary, the era has changed and continuation of age old methods of employee acceptance needs a change. This can be bought by replacing the system with either  questionnaire pamphlet or multiple short tests. For example, all the interviewing  questions, exam can be taken or else multiple different field exam.

Many people argue that children should learn this skill of recycling objects at school, while others insist that parents should teach this to their children.  I admit that parents can act as a guide or mentor, but I firmly believe that in academy students can get practical knowledge also. This essay will discuss both the views by demonstrating facts and points.\r\n\r\nTo begin with, it is very important to protect the environment from getting polluted. For this, schools can introduce a compulsory subject of waste management in the curriculum. Therefore, children will learn more about it as dedicated time slot will be allocated for exploring this issue. Moreover, children will get hands-on experience and practical knowledge too. It is evident that cognition and intellectual skills are developed more by performing group activities. Peers play a vital role in encouraging and inculcating interest in things which aloof individual finds hard to incur. So, school can act as a channel to motivate its students in reducing the misuse.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, kids at home imitate what their parents do. For example, the way parents eat, communicate, etc. Similarly, parents should imbibe the habits of reducing and reusing left over items in themselves, which will be ultimately inherited to the next generation. It has been always stated that home is the first school of the kids. Therefore, parents should indulge their kids in such activities and help then in becoming responsible citizens of the nation. \r\n\r\n To conclude, parents are the primary source of the knowledge of the kids and what parents can do nobody can do.

they believe that a country should promote democracy,as a result, the mental health of an individual will rise which will ultimately benefit their citizens.For ,instance a survey conveys the message

Discuss both views and give your own opinion?\n\nScore this IELTS Task 2 essay according to the rubric, ensuring alignment with the question:\n\nMuseums are the major tourist attractions in every country.  Some people believe that museum tours should be filled with fun so that they can enjoy more, whereas others think that they are meant to provide information and educate people. In my opinion, I agree with the notion of museums reserved for educating the visiting crowd, rather than entertaining them.\r\n\r\nFirstly, people visit historical places like museums or art galleries to know the ancient stories of that particular place. With museums depicting the past glories or the sacrifices made by the ancestors of that place, it connects the visitors with the local community. One cannot look for entertainment at all places, as some are reserved for specific purposes. For instance, students are taken to museums with an intention of connecting them with the history and culture of the land. The antique materials that are preserved in such places, provides the much needed information about life in those days. This will also inspire students to achieve greater things in life as they get connected with famous personalities and their lifestyle.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, although, art and science galleries are informative, it becomes a bit boring to the younger generation due to a lot of restrictions. People should be allowed to perform some tasks related to the theme of museums. Besides, introducing some interactive programs like stage shows or live experiments will engage the audience effectively. Not everyone who visits the museum is looking for lessons or information, hence innovative concepts should be introduced to make their visit more enjoyable. As a result, people get the information required as well as being entertained at the same time.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, I believe museums are meant for providing knowledge, whether it is art, science, culture or any other theme-based museums, their main motto is to educate the crowd.

This is due to major distractions such as social media and the high volume of stress in their life. Proper counselling and guidance can resolve these issues.\r\n\r\nFirstly, we have to focus on the reason for the distractions in students' life. The excessive use of social media and more  dedication towards virtual images takes a lot of time and effort, hence minimizing the focus on education. Taking the example of Apple reports, children aged 12-16 years use mobile phones approximately 8 to 12 hours per day.\r\n\r\nThe second reason can be contributed to the high stress in students' lifestyles. Students nowadays are facing huge competition in terms of career and life. Taking a real-life example, a class 5th student is expected to choose subjects based on his future career. Most of the students end up taking subjects under peer pressure. This result in slowly losing interest in studies and ending up frustrated and disturbed. \r\n\r\nFurthermore, steps should be taken to acknowledge these problems. Students should be educated on the disadvantages of using social media. They should be counselled on what subjects to be chosen on basis of interests. Overall every student is unique and should be approached in a different manner.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, the purpose of education is to  impart knowledge in such a manner that children can actually learn the greater purpose of life, that is education is a bridge to achieving something bigger in life.

What are the reasons for this?  How can people research this?\n\nScore this IELTS Task 2 essay according to the rubric, ensuring alignment with the question:\n\nIn our rather futuristic society for a number of reasons people are getting more interested in the  past of their hometowns. With the help of rapidly ameliorating technology their desire to learn  about the history can be easily put into life. But what are the roots of such  eagerness?  First of all, the hectic lifestyle that we all experience nowadays does not leave any space for  calmness and peace in our souls, so most of the people - especially adolescence - are struggling  with finding their feet, whilst having a broad spectrum of knowledge about the world around really  gives a feeling of confidence in the impermanence of life. In addition to this, it is said that being  aware of the past you can change the future. Consequently, if people want to live a better life in more comfortable environment, they have to explore the history of their homes in order not to  repeat past mistakes.  For this aims we are lucky to have multiple tools to carry out research into the subject. Despite  libraries being considered as an old-fashioned and not necessarily convinient approach of learning,  there are actually quite a few books and magazines which are not available online but which are  extremely helpful when it comes to the local interests.

I do think that younger criminals should have behaved less strictly than older offenders. In this essay, I will discuss the viewpoint and give relevant ideas about the issue.\r\n\r\nTo begin with, young adults are less mature compared to adults this is why they should not be considered in the same punishments.Furthermore, sometimes they are more susceptible to being afflicted by bad peers or role models.To make an example, many of them may join  aggressive gangs,in which they commit a sort of illegal work like; smoking, teasing, hijacking and so on. Therefore, the youth should not be punished the same as the grown man who committed the types of offensive words.\r\n\r\nBesides, less proper guidance and violations from one's parents can be the main reasons for youngsters becoming criminals.In addition , nowadays parents are often busy with work so that they may be involved with some unwanted crimes like stealing something pen,pencil, sharpener and many more.To explain , punishments must be more flexible for children having such backgrounds. Thus, in this way, it is significant to consider their circumstance and why they inevitably commit crimes.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, if youngsters commit crimes, their lack of responsibility and surroundings should be considered when they are handled by authorities, in order to rehabilitate them effectively.

In some countries, celebrities complain about the way the media publicizes their private lives. Some people say that they should accept it as part of their fame. Do you agree or disagree?\n\nScore this IELTS Task 2 essay according to the rubric, ensuring alignment with the question:\n\nIt is inevitable for prominent people to have a lot of attention from the public. Therefore, some famous individuals make a complaint to the media in order to have their boundaries. Some people insist that they have to admit this phenomenon as part of their fame. However, I strongly disagree with this opinion. This is because famous people have a right to have private space in their lives and they might be victims of criminals.\r\n\r\nTo begin with, eminent people have a right to have their own space in their daily lives. In fact, everyone needs a private room where they can be protected from external factors including famous people. Having a boundary plays a pivotal role in people's lives. When people's rights are invaded by other elements, they might be able to have mental issues such as depression, anxiety, and so on. To cite an example, some celebrities in South Korea struggle with their mental problems since they do not have enough space for their schedule. They protest to media companies to stop posting their life in order to tackle this problem. Sometimes, they have medicines or conduct sessions to deal with their stress. Moreover, This situation might lead their fandoms to have a sense of worry and a lot of entertainment companies to lose their assets as prominent people in our society.\r\n\r\nIn addition, celebrities might be able to become victims of awful people. The number of criminals has been increasing nowadays, some people, called a stoker, cross the private rooms. They are more likely to invade eminent people's daily lives by following their schedules every single day and taking a majority of pictures. Sometimes, they even attack celebrities physically. For example, there was a serious crime in China. One prominent actress, named Wan Wei was captured by a stoker. The criminal said that he was able to check her life by watching media news all the time. This means that too much information about celebrities' lives might cause detrimental situations for them such as stoking, captures, and so on.\r\n\r\nTo sum up, it is evident that some people reckon that they deserve to monitor celebrities' lives because of their fame.

Some people agree with this. However, others think government should spend more on health and education. Discuss both sides and giver your opinion.\n\nScore this IELTS Task 2 essay according to the rubric, ensuring alignment with the question:\n\nIt is often argued that the government prefers spending money on arts rather than public services. Public services are examples of caring about the well-being of the citizens and educational system of the country. Investing on arts is important. At the same time, such urgent needs require equal attention too.\r\n\r\nGovernment fundings in the art sector will definitely be able to attract tourists from all over the world. For example in Singapore, there are many lazer lighting shows put up in the city annually. Foreigners along with Singaporeans are able to admire the beauty of the word put up by the artists. Similarly, the Art Museums are free for the public to enter. This allows viewers to not only appreciate the creativity but more importantly, learn about the history behind the paintings hung on the walls. Hence, spending money on arts should be encouraged.\r\n\r\nPerformances such as music, dance and plays are also part of arts. Spectating a broadway musical is also a perfect example of such entertainment. Seated audiences in the concert theatres are able to sit back, relax, and enjoy the show put up by the performers.\r\n\r\nYet, leaders of the country should place their focus on healthcare as well. For instance, the recent pandemic has shed light to many that healthcare must not be overlooked. The demand for high technology equipments to treat rose drastically as large number of patients had fallen ill due to the virus. It clearly shows that without the help of science, treatment would have been slower and the spread would be uncontrollable.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, having a better education system impacts the society indirectly. With the aid of better teachers, the knowledge gained by students in the classroom will further expand, practicing critical thinking. In the future while working in the workfore, inevitably, students have the capability and ability to overcome challenges and contribute to the economy. Thus, education is an important part of the society and should not be neglected. \r\n\r\nWith that, I feel that proper funding of arts sector is crucial for the society although government's investments in public services play a very important role in our community. For example, any country can live without music concerts, but absence of medicine will create significant problems. Not only that, the lack of education will open the possiblities of the country undergoing poverty where this effect is evident in most third world countries.

What are the reasons for this? What can be done to solve this problem\n\nScore this IELTS Task 2 essay according to the rubric, ensuring alignment with the question:\n\nIn today's world, children struggle to concentrate on their studies. There are many factors in consideration to be considered. I will explain the causes one by one in this essay.\r\n\r\nFirstly, in this technology era, many schools have made it compulsory that they will electronics as a teaching medium. Consequently, parents were forced to buy pads, laptops or mobile phones for their kids. Having access to gadgets at such small age, teenagers get easily influenced by things shown on the internet. It has been seen that many students get addicted to video games and play them with their friends till late at night. As they don't get sufficient sleep, it becomes really difficult for them to pay attention at school. At teenage, ,,generally people have an urge to get popular at the institute. Consequently, girls get trapped in social media apps. For example, a cousin of mine is an Instagram influencer. Due to the algorithm of insta, she has to post a picture or video daily to remain active and to not lose followers. This has impacted her grades in a bizarre manner.\r\n\r\nSecondly, in this competitive world, couples want their child to be an all-rounder. Furthermore, they want him or her to do extraordinary tasks in every field. As a result, it becomes burdensome for their offspring to focus on sports as well as on education simultaneously. For instance, my childhood friend is a great football player. Moreover,he even participates at the state and national levels. As he has to attend competitions and got to travel to many places, he doesn't get enough time to study. His forerunners and teachers pressurized him a lot to pay attention to his schooling also.\r\n\r\nTo conclude, i would like to reiterate my statement that there are many aspects to the problem as discussed above due to which pupils face issues to get good grades. We can't put the whole blame on kids. To solve this complication, school authorities need to put screen time on cell phones and a kid should not be burden with extra circular activities.\n\nProvide your assessment in the specified JSON format."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"per_criterion\": [{\"name\": \"Task Response\", \"band\": 6.5, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"In today's world, children struggle to concentrate on their studies.\", \"To solve this complication, school authorities need to put screen time on cell phones and a kid should not be burden with extra circular activities.\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"there are many factors in consideration to be considered\", \"type\": \"clarity\", \"fix\": \"rephrase to 'there are many factors to consider'\"}, {\"span\": \"At teenage, ,,generally people have an urge to get popular at the institute.\", \"type\": \"grammar\", \"fix\": \"rephrase to 'During their teenage years, individuals generally have an urge to become popular at school.'\"}, {\"span\": \"a kid should not be burden with extra circular activities.\", \"type\": \"grammar\", \"fix\": \"correct to 'a kid should not be burdened with extracurricular activities.'\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Provide more specific examples to support the claims made about the impact of technology and competition on children's focus.\", \"Ensure clarity and coherence by avoiding repetitive phrases and improving sentence structure.\", \"Strengthen the conclusion by summarizing the main points more effectively and suggesting practical solutions.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Coherence & Cohesion\", \"band\": 5.5, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"Firstly, in this technology era, many schools have made it compulsory that they will electronics as a teaching medium.\", \"To conclude, i would like to reiterate my statement that there are many aspects to the problem as discussed above due to which pupils face issues to get good grades.\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"there are many factors in consideration to be considered\", \"type\": \"redundancy\", \"fix\": \"replace with 'there are many factors to consider'\"}, {\"span\": \"At teenage, ,,generally people have an urge to get popular at the institute.\", \"type\": \"punctuation and clarity\", \"fix\": \"correct punctuation and clarify the subject, e.g., 'At this age, teenagers generally have an urge to become popular at school.'\"}, {\"span\": \"a kid should not be burden with extra circular activities.\", \"type\": \"word choice\", \"fix\": \"replace 'burden' with 'burdened' and 'extra circular' with 'extracurricular'.\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Use clearer topic sentences to introduce each paragraph and improve the flow of ideas.\", \"Avoid redundancy by ensuring phrases are concise and to the point.\", \"Ensure proper punctuation and grammar to enhance clarity and coherence.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Lexical Resource\", \"band\": 5.5, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"in this technology era\", \"it becomes burdensome for their offspring to focus on sports as well as on education simultaneously\", \"we can't put the whole blame on kids\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"in consideration to be considered\", \"type\": \"redundancy\", \"fix\": \"in consideration\"}, {\"span\": \"at such small age\", \"type\": \"incorrect phrase\", \"fix\": \"at such a young age\"}, {\"span\": \"a kid should not be burden with extra circular activities\", \"type\": \"incorrect word form\", \"fix\": \"a kid should not be burdened with extracurricular activities\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Use more varied vocabulary to express ideas, avoiding repetition and redundancy.\", \"Pay attention to correct word forms and phrases to enhance clarity.\", \"Incorporate more complex sentence structures to demonstrate a higher level of lexical resource.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Grammatical Range & Accuracy\", \"band\": 6.5, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"In today's world, children struggle to concentrate on their studies.\", \"As they don't get sufficient sleep, it becomes really difficult for them to pay attention at school.\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"in consideration to be considered\", \"type\": \"redundancy\", \"fix\": \"in consideration\"}, {\"span\": \"at teenage\", \"type\": \"incorrect phrase\", \"fix\": \"in their teenage years\"}, {\"span\": \"a kid should not be burden with extra circular activities\", \"type\": \"incorrect form\", \"fix\": \"a kid should not be burdened with extracurricular activities\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Avoid redundancy in phrases to improve clarity.\", \"Use more precise phrases to enhance grammatical accuracy.\", \"Ensure correct verb forms and word choices to avoid errors.\"]}], \"overall\": 6.0}"}]}

Furthermore, some lectures such as theatre and music help kids to socialize and make new friends at school age.

Therefore, art courses at elementary school encourage them to be more extroverted in their social life throughout the beginning of the education years.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, not every kid should be forced to take the same art classes because some might have completely different desires. Moreover, when a young person is obligated to take an art class that they are not good at, this might break their motivation especially if they are compared to their classmates who are good at the given art courses. For example, everyone should be free to choose the lectures that they are interested in as some children may be more active in sports or quantitative subjects rather than arts.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, they are cons and pros to having art courses as a kid.

Benefits such as communication with friends abroad as well as informing your loved ones about good or bad news have been the highlight. In addition, with the trend of newspapers diminishing, online websites have provided a gateway for easy access to news worldwide within seconds. For example, in Canada, there are 50 different news channels which provide every 15-minute update of international events online. Hence, social media has been the greatest achievement in the last decade.\r\n\r\nOn the contrary, human interactions such as conversations over coffee have been confined to chat groups. Furthermore, various countries had to put a ban on certain websites for promoting hatred among society as well as manipulation of the general public with false facts. For instance, a recent study suggests that 85% of people using these tend to believe everything they see online. Consequently, censorship of these websites is required.\r\n\r\nTo conclude, I believe that the pros of social media outweigh the cons. It depends on the individual to use the current technology for the betterment of society. Significant improvements have been made in online shopping, news communication along with easy access to people living far.\n\nProvide your assessment in the specified JSON format."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"per_criterion\": [{\"name\": \"Task Response\", \"band\": 9.0, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"I believe the advantages of this technology certainly outweigh the disadvantages.\", \"I believe that the pros of social media outweigh the cons.\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"just as dating, job hunt, news.\", \"type\": \"incomplete list\", \"fix\": \"revise to 'such as dating, job hunting, and news.'\"}, {\"span\": \"human interaction has been made simpler with the advancement of time.\", \"type\": \"vague phrasing\", \"fix\": \"clarify the specific advancements in technology that have simplified human interaction.\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Provide more specific examples of the advantages and disadvantages of social media to strengthen the argument.\", \"Ensure that all lists are grammatically complete and parallel in structure.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Coherence & Cohesion\", \"band\": 8.0, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"the advantages of this technology certainly outweigh the disadvantages\", \"human interaction has been made simpler with the advancement of time\", \"I believe that the pros of social media outweigh the cons\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"just as dating, job hunt, news\", \"type\": \"parallel structure\", \"fix\": \"use parallel structure: 'such as dating, job hunting, and news'\"}, {\"span\": \"communication with friends abroad as well as informing your loved ones about good or bad news\", \"type\": \"clarity\", \"fix\": \"rephrase for clarity: 'communicating with friends abroad and informing loved ones about good or bad news'\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Ensure parallel structure in lists to improve clarity and flow.\", \"Use more cohesive devices to link ideas between sentences and paragraphs.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Lexical Resource\", \"band\": 8.0, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"science has advanced drastically\", \"social media apps provide a way of distraction\", \"the pros of social media outweigh the cons\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"just as dating, job hunt, news\", \"type\": \"inappropriate collocation\", \"fix\": \"such as dating, job hunting, and news\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Use more varied vocabulary to express similar ideas, such as replacing 'advancement' with 'progress' or 'development' in different contexts.\", \"Incorporate more complex sentence structures to enhance the sophistication of the writing.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Grammatical Range & Accuracy\", \"band\": 9.0, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"science has advanced drastically with the development of social media apps for interaction among people.\", \"human interaction has been made simpler with the advancement of time.\", \"the pros of social media outweigh the cons.\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"just as dating, job hunt, news.\", \"type\": \"punctuation error\", \"fix\": \"should be 'such as dating, job hunting, and news.'\"}, {\"span\": \"provide a way of distraction in the day to day life stress.\", \"type\": \"article error\", \"fix\": \"should be 'provide a way of distraction from the day-to-day life stress.'\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Use more varied sentence structures to enhance the complexity of the writing.\", \"Ensure consistent use of articles and prepositions for improved grammatical accuracy.\"]}], \"overall\": 8.5}"}]}

In my opinion, a museum should be both entertaining and educational.\r\n\r\nOn the one hand, it is said that museums should be entertaining. This is because if museums put emphasis on entertainment, many families may be encouraged to spend their free time by going to museums rather than doing a useless activity like watching TV. For example, holding some games in museums can be an effective way to attract visitors, and bring joy to them. However, emphasizing on education can turn museums to a boring place, as a result of which this monotony may put the public off going to exhibitions. \r\n\r\nOn the other hand, others hold the view that museums should be educational. Firstly, because these places should broaden visitors’ horizons about their local culture and history. By following this way, it is highly unlikely for a country’s culture and background to be forgotten as museums act as reminder and help visitors to remember the history and customs of their community. For instance, putting some paintings about the ancestors of a country on display can help local people to remember parts of their history. Secondly, since museums are open to the public of all age groups they should take advantage of this opportunity and educate visitors so as to solve many problems. For instance, environmental issues can be addressed if people are taught how to reuse their stuff. \r\n\r\nIn conclusion.

But it has pros and cons. Some people believe that it is not good to see television for children in all ways whereas others think that it helps to develop their growth. In my view, both points are true as will be explained in the following essay.\r\n\r\nTo begin with, the effects of watching television cause some major disadvantages, particularly what the subjects they are watching. For example, if they continuously watch Wrestling programs then, they tend to imitate this hence they start fighting with friends or other students in class. Moreover, these entertainments make them more addictive and become less concentrated in studies. Besides that, they will pretend to the action movies or thriller movies in their real life. Therefore, it causes very dangerous situations especially resulting in spoiling their life.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, if children are watching good programs providing knowledge to their life and studies is beneficial. For instance, programs such as a documentary about wildlife sanctuary or travelogues about different places give vast ideas about different things. Furthermore, good entertainment is also essential for their mental development to develop thinking capability and raise their art skills. However, it is important the amount of time they are spending on this. In addition to that, language skills also can develop by watching different language programs.\r\n\r\nTo conclude, watching television is a good practice if they are used in a good manner.

Most masses believe children habits are spoiled by watching television. Others think in the favour of this, as they grow up. This essay intends to discuss  both views and I will discuss my opinion in the forthcoming paragraphs.\r\n\r\nThe reasons why people believe watching tv has benefits on children. Firstly, children have a hectic schedule, they spend the most time in  school and later they have to do homework which had given by their teachers then spend some time on tv by watching their favourite show gives them relaxation from the study. Secondly, many education programs telecast on the tv and watching the right kind of shows increase knowledge. Finally, some children decide their career by watching sports, food, music, and arts from the tv program. For instance, most sportspeople choose sports by watching their favourite games. Therefore, Virat Kohli is one of them and he is the greatest cricketer in  history.\r\n\r\nOther individuals have a negative point on this. They say that children become lazy and couch potatoes by spending the most time in front of the television and the ratio of the obesity problem in the children are increasing every year, in spite of this their eyesight become weak. Further, many violent and vulgar shows are broadcast on tv, which affects them mentally due to this they develop some bad habits at an early age, later this becomes a great problem in their life.\r\n\r\nI believe that watching tv has an advantage for  toddlers. They learn many things from this such as cooking, art skills, sports, and some dance moves. Whereas, it is one of the greatest things to kill boredom in life.\r\n\r\nTo conclude, \"every coin has two sides.\" Parents should limit the time of watching television and watch tv with them so that they could not watch some aggressive shows.\n\nProvide your assessment in the specified JSON format."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"per_criterion\": [{\"name\": \"Task Response\", \"band\": 4.5, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"This essay intends to discuss both views and I will discuss my opinion in the forthcoming paragraphs.\", \"I believe that watching tv has an advantage for toddlers.\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"the ratio of the obesity problem in the children are increasing every year\", \"type\": \"grammatical error\", \"fix\": \"the ratio of obesity problems in children is increasing every year\"}, {\"span\": \"they learn many things from this such as cooking, art skills, sports, and some dance moves.\", \"type\": \"lack of clarity\", \"fix\": \"they learn many things from it, such as cooking, art skills, sports, and dance moves.\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Provide clearer topic sentences for each paragraph to enhance the structure of the argument.\", \"Expand on the negative impacts of television on children to balance the discussion of both views.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Coherence & Cohesion\", \"band\": 3.5, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"This essay intends to discuss both views and I will discuss my opinion in the forthcoming paragraphs.\", \"I believe that watching tv has an advantage for toddlers.\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"the reasons why people believe watching tv has benefits on children.\", \"type\": \"incomplete sentence structure\", \"fix\": \"Change to 'There are several reasons why people believe watching TV has benefits for children.'\"}, {\"span\": \"the ratio of the obesity problem in the children are increasing every year\", \"type\": \"subject-verb agreement\", \"fix\": \"Change to 'the ratio of obesity problems in children is increasing every year.'\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Use clearer topic sentences to introduce each paragraph's main idea.\", \"Ensure subject-verb agreement is correct throughout the essay.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Lexical Resource\", \"band\": 3.5, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"In this cutting-edge era, TV becomes part of our life.\", \"the ratio of the obesity problem in the children are increasing every year\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"children habits are spoiled by watching television\", \"type\": \"word choice\", \"fix\": \"children's habits are negatively affected by watching television\"}, {\"span\": \"the ratio of the obesity problem in the children are increasing every year\", \"type\": \"subject-verb agreement\", \"fix\": \"the ratio of obesity problems in children is increasing every year\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Use more precise vocabulary to convey ideas more clearly.\", \"Pay attention to subject-verb agreement to improve grammatical accuracy.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Grammatical Range & Accuracy\", \"band\": 4.5, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"This essay intends to discuss both views and I will discuss my opinion in the forthcoming paragraphs.\", \"They learn many things from this such as cooking, art skills, sports, and some dance moves.\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"children habits are spoiled\", \"type\": \"subject-verb agreement\", \"fix\": \"children's habits are spoiled\"}, {\"span\": \"the ratio of the obesity problem in the children are increasing\", \"type\": \"subject-verb agreement\", \"fix\": \"the ratio of the obesity problem in children is increasing\"}, {\"span\": \"their eyesight become weak\", \"type\": \"subject-verb agreement\", \"fix\": \"their eyesight becomes weak\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Use possessive forms correctly, such as 'children's habits' instead of 'children habits'.\", \"Ensure subject-verb agreement is maintained throughout the essay.\", \"Vary sentence structures to enhance grammatical range, such as using more complex sentences.\"]}], \"overall\": 4.0}"}]}

Others think the parents should be punished instead.\r\n\r\nDiscuss both views and give your own opinion.\n\nScore this IELTS Task 2 essay according to the rubric, ensuring alignment with the question:\n\nSome today are calling for parents to be held responsible for crimes committed by their children. In my opinion, there are exceptions but many cases merit greater punishment for parents.\r\n\r\nThose arguing against this reform point out that parents are not always culpable. There are numerous instances of loving parents who raise their child well but social problems still manifest from a young age. This is often the case if the child suffers from a mental illness such as schizophrenia or a dissociative disorder. These conditions may stem from simple genetics, in which case parents should not be punished, or from trauma the primary caregivers are unaware of. For example, if they have been abused at school or by a relative then it follows logically the offending, rather than innocent, party should be brought into justice.\r\n\r\nDespite the important exceptions above that courts must sort through, parental abuse and neglect should be punishable. Studies have shown that most young children who commit crimes have been abused in some way by their parents. Serial killers are an extreme but useful case in point. Nearly every serial killer begins antisocial behaviour from a young age, including the criminal torture of animals. There are also no known examples of serial killers coming from happy homes; they are all the product of varying degrees of abuse from their parents. This is clear evidence that parents play a pivotal role in moulding the psyche of young children. As children grow up and have more influences this may change but for young children, parents are chiefly responsible and courts should recognise this fact.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, there are some cases where parents may not be at fault for criminal acts by children but in most situations, they are the driving force. Trying parents for their child’s crime and seeking treatment for the children would therefore be a modern, progressive, and positive reform.\n\nProvide your assessment in the specified JSON format."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"per_criterion\": [{\"name\": \"Coherence & Cohesion\", \"band\": 7.5, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"there are exceptions but many cases merit greater punishment for parents\", \"parents are chiefly responsible and courts should recognise this fact\", \"in most situations, they are the driving force\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"if they have been abused at school or by a relative then it follows logically the offending, rather than innocent, party should be brought into justice\", \"type\": \"sentence structure\", \"fix\": \"Consider rephrasing for clarity: 'if they have been abused at school or by a relative, it logically follows that the offending party, rather than the innocent one, should be brought to justice.'\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Use more linking words to enhance the flow between ideas, such as 'however', 'furthermore', and 'in addition'.\", \"Ensure that each paragraph has a clear topic sentence that summarizes the main idea to improve overall coherence.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Task Response\", \"band\": 8.0, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"there are exceptions but many cases merit greater punishment for parents\", \"parents are chiefly responsible and courts should recognise this fact\", \"in most situations, they are the driving force\"], \"errors\": [], \"suggestions\": [\"Provide more specific examples of cases where parents have been held accountable to strengthen the argument.\", \"Consider addressing potential counterarguments more thoroughly to demonstrate a balanced perspective.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Lexical Resource\", \"band\": 7.0, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"parents should not be punished\", \"pivotal role in moulding the psyche of young children\", \"modern, progressive, and positive reform\"], \"errors\": [], \"suggestions\": [\"Consider using more varied vocabulary to express similar ideas, such as using synonyms for 'parents' or 'children' to avoid repetition.\", \"Incorporate more complex sentence structures to enhance the sophistication of the language used.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Grammatical Range & Accuracy\", \"band\": 7.0, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"There are numerous instances of loving parents who raise their child well but social problems still manifest from a young age.\", \"This is often the case if the child suffers from a mental illness such as schizophrenia or a dissociative disorder.\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"the offending, rather than innocent, party should be brought into justice\", \"type\": \"preposition error\", \"fix\": \"the offending, rather than innocent, party should be brought to justice\"}, {\"span\": \"this may change but for young children\", \"type\": \"punctuation error\", \"fix\": \"this may change, but for young children\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Ensure correct preposition usage, especially with phrases like 'brought into justice' which should be 'brought to justice'.\", \"Use commas to separate clauses for better readability, as in 'this may change, but for young children'.\"]}], \"overall\": 7.5}"}]}

To what extent do you agree or disagree.\n\nScore this IELTS Task 2 essay according to the rubric, ensuring alignment with the question:\n\nNowadays, sports are being used by sponsors to launch their new products in the market. According to a group of folks, it is a great matter of concern as it takes away the spirit of the game. I personally disagree with the statement as it attracts a good chunk of money which later can be used for future sports events. \r\n\r\nTo begin with, Money is the biggest factor behind this trend as it is hard to deny the fact that organizing a sporting event takes time and millions of dollars, especially when it comes to an international-level game. Moreover, to get that big amount of money they contact companies that can help them to build big stadiums and hotels for players. After all, players need money for food as well, the government could not simply bear thousands of players across the globe so in that case they ask big firms for help. For instance, Tata Group helped India to organize an Asia Games back in 2010. it took over 3 billion US dollars just to build the big stadiums and tracks for the game.\r\n\r\nIn addition, people who think that it is killing game spirit simply think only from the game perspective as those individuals do not know that the game they are watching on their television is actually backed by a sponsor channel. Moving further, players also get their prize in the form of a cheque. In a favour, all they do is promote their products during events as it helps both the game and the sponsors. For instance, During the Tokyo Olympics, over 2000 companies made a profit worth billions of dollars simply by showcasing their products on TV during breaks.  \r\n\r\nTo conclude, to keep sports alive it is crucial for organizers to ask big companies for help, and in return, they can get their products prompted by influential players, which can help them to make some money.

Nowadays, in various countries, despite the fact they are developed or under-developed crime is a serious issue which leads to imprisonment, but there are people who believe that this is not a fruitful step.

These various nations have implemented the rule to punish  offenders by keeping them in prison. This helps to keep them away from innocent beings out in cities so there is less risk of violation and transgression. But in prison, these crime mafias build their small cartels which further leads to more aggression, on the other hand when they are released after completing their sentence they again indulged in these wrong deeds. For instance, recently I was studying a criminal case which describes how a murderer gets evicted from jail and after that he becomes more dangerous as he kills all those who were witnesses in his court trial. So, keeping them away from  society seems a better solution but there is more that needs to be done.\r\n\r\nAs we have discussed,  there are cases when there is no change in the mental situation of offenders inside the jail, therefore it is required to make them educated while they are serving their punishment. This helps to make them more responsible and understand their role as a positive force within the world. The major cause of crime is lack of money which is the result of unemployment, if lawbreakers learn new things, then they are more likely to follow the right path. For instance, the Government of India has implemented a skill-based learning course within the prison so that people can grab  opportunities after they get evicted.\r\n\r\nTo conclude, it is evident to build secured prisons for wrongdoers keeps them isolated, but on the other ,hand it is also required to train them mentally, so that they will transform into good human beings.\n\nProvide your assessment in the specified JSON format."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"per_criterion\": [{\"name\": \"Task Response\", \"band\": 7.5, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"I am going to discuss why I do not agree with this thought\", \"it is required to make them educated while they are serving their punishment\", \"the major cause of crime is lack of money which is the result of unemployment\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"there are people who believe that this is not a fruitful step\", \"type\": \"clarity\", \"fix\": \"Clarify who 'these people' are and what their reasoning is.\"}, {\"span\": \"keeping them away from innocent beings out in cities\", \"type\": \"word choice\", \"fix\": \"Consider using 'innocent people' instead of 'innocent beings' for clarity.\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Provide more specific examples or data to support claims about crime rates and rehabilitation.\", \"Clarify the connection between education and crime reduction to strengthen the argument.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Coherence & Cohesion\", \"band\": 6.5, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"there is a negative effect of these bad actions on numerous people.\", \"it is required to make them educated while they are serving their punishment.\", \"the Government of India has implemented a skill-based learning course within the prison\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"on the other ,hand\", \"type\": \"punctuation error\", \"fix\": \"remove the space before the comma\"}, {\"span\": \"keeping them in prison.

In the first place, they can be used as a way of recreation. For instance, in Vietnam, parents often open commercials which have catchy songs or sound to calm their kids down.

One compelling fact is that  most advertisements on the Internet affect users’ privacy. For example, Facebook sells personal information for advertising purposes. Additionally, commercials appear on all devices  and they make users feel annoyed because they are such time-consuming things. Furthermore, nowadays, there are manifold inappropriate advertisements. To illustrate, they can mislead people who are duplicitous and then steal their money. Moreover, some advertisements can also affect kids by ruining children’s minds with inappropriate content and images.\r\n\r\nTaking a glance at the previous points, advertisements provide both benefits and drawbacks for humans.

To what extent do you agree or disagree?\n\nScore this IELTS Task 2 essay according to the rubric, ensuring alignment with the question:\n\nThe assertion that team sports are the best method to teach youngsters how to cooperate is a viewpoint that has gained considerable attention. Although team sports can indeed foster collaboration skills, I believe that there are other effective avenues for teaching cooperation as well.\r\n\r\nEssentially, team sports are very efficient when it comes to teaching young people how to cooperate with each other. Through a competitive environment, teenagers develop teamwork skills, self-esteem and strategising. For example, students can have many opportunities to recognise the strengths as well as the shortcomings of each teammate which can be used to better compete against their opponents, especially in sports with more than 5 participants such as football, volleyball and basketball. Additionally, playing sports also stimulates a working environment where people work towards a common goal together. Thus, pupils learn how to work together more effectively when they engage in these sporting activities.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, it is important to recognize that cooperation skills can be cultivated through a range of activities beyond team sports. Firstly, cooperative learning strategies in classrooms, group projects, community service activities and even creative pursuits like theatre or music can also provide valuable opportunities for young adults to develop collaboration skills. In fact, these activities promote cooperation, and the ability to work effectively in a group setting. They encourage the youth to understand diverse perspectives, value teamwork and appreciate the benefit of collective effort. Secondly, not all offspring may be inclined toward or have the opportunity to participate in team sports. Thus, it is essential to provide a range of activities and environments that cater to diverse interests or abilities, ensuring that all youngsters have a chance to develop their cooperation skills.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, while team sports offer valuable opportunities for teaching offspring to cooperate, I believe that cooperation skills can be developed through a variety of activities and environments. By providing a balanced approach that includes all activities, we can effectively nurture the value and skill of cooperation in adolescents.\n\nProvide your assessment in the specified JSON format."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"per_criterion\": [{\"name\": \"Task Response\", \"band\": 7.5, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"team sports can indeed foster collaboration skills\", \"cooperation skills can be cultivated through a range of activities beyond team sports\", \"it is essential to provide a range of activities and environments that cater to diverse interests or abilities\"], \"errors\": [], \"suggestions\": [\"Consider providing more specific examples of non-sport activities that teach cooperation to strengthen the argument.\", \"Clarify the conclusion by summarizing the key points made in the essay to reinforce the overall argument.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Coherence & Cohesion\", \"band\": 6.5, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"team sports can indeed foster collaboration skills\", \"cooperation skills can be cultivated through a range of activities beyond team sports\", \"it is essential to provide a range of activities and environments that cater to diverse interests or abilities\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"students can have many opportunities to recognise the strengths as well as the shortcomings of each teammate\", \"type\": \"clarity\", \"fix\": \"Consider rephrasing to clarify how recognizing strengths and shortcomings directly contributes to cooperation.\"}, {\"span\": \"By providing a balanced approach that includes all activities\", \"type\": \"specificity\", \"fix\": \"Specify what 'all activities' entails to enhance clarity.\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Use clearer transitions between paragraphs to improve the flow of ideas.\", \"Provide specific examples of non-sport activities that teach cooperation to enhance the argument.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Lexical Resource\", \"band\": 6.5, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"team sports are the best method to teach youngsters how to cooperate\", \"cooperative learning strategies in classrooms, group projects, community service activities and even creative pursuits like theatre or music can also provide valuable opportunities for young adults to develop collaboration skills\", \"the ability to work effectively in a group setting\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"strategising\", \"type\": \"word choice\", \"fix\": \"strategizing (American English) or strategising (British English)\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Consider using more varied vocabulary to express similar ideas, such as synonyms for 'cooperate' or 'collaboration'.\", \"Incorporate more complex sentence structures to enhance the sophistication of your writing.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Grammatical Range & Accuracy\", \"band\": 7.5, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"team sports can indeed foster collaboration skills\", \"students can have many opportunities to recognise the strengths as well as the shortcomings of each teammate\", \"cooperation skills can be cultivated through a range of activities beyond team sports\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"strategising\", \"type\": \"spelling error\", \"fix\": \"strategizing\"}, {\"span\": \"the youth to understand diverse perspectives\", \"type\": \"word choice\", \"fix\": \"youth to understand diverse perspectives\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Consider using more varied sentence structures to enhance the complexity of your writing.\", \"Ensure consistency in spelling, particularly between British and American English.\"]}], \"overall\": 7.0}"}]}
