They perform all the actions like human touch when one is crying or in grief.

Robots are great electronic devices built with artificial intelligence that perform duties as instructed. For example, robots are widely used in the role of detecting and diffusing bombs, serving food at a restaurant. Moreover, robots are ideal in  jobs where human lives can be saved.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, we want to extend the advantages of our inventions and try to implement benefits in all possible ways. But it may not be feasible at all times. For example, a robot cannot replace a mother or a teacher. Robot's do not have any natural emotions which are required while performing certain jobs. A robot cannot take its own  decision to avert  damage or decide if a drive can be postponed, in case of heavy rain. Humans are good at taking a stand based on the situation they are in. For this distinct reason, though robots can perform certain operations, humans are irreplaceable.\r\n\r\nTo conclude, I opine that technology should be used to benefit humans than replacing them, though artificial intelligence built robots support mankind in achieving desired tasks.\n\nProvide your assessment in the specified JSON format."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"per_criterion\": [{\"name\": \"Task Response\", \"band\": 8.5, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"I feel that it is rubbish to presume.\", \"Robots are great electronic devices built with artificial intelligence that perform duties as instructed.\", \"humans are irreplaceable.\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"every job does by humans\", \"type\": \"grammatical\", \"fix\": \"every job done by humans\"}, {\"span\": \"Robot's do not have any natural emotions\", \"type\": \"grammatical\", \"fix\": \"Robots do not have any natural emotions\"}, {\"span\": \"technology should be used to benefit humans than replacing them\", \"type\": \"clarity\", \"fix\": \"technology should be used to benefit humans rather than replacing them\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Clarify the introduction to clearly state the position on the topic.\", \"Provide more specific examples of jobs that robots cannot perform effectively.\", \"Strengthen the conclusion by summarizing key points and reiterating the stance on the relationship between technology and humanity.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Coherence & Cohesion\", \"band\": 7.5, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"humans always enjoyed inventions and today we have for the same reason we have robots.\", \"a robot cannot replace a mother or a teacher.\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"Robot's do not have any natural emotions\", \"type\": \"punctuation error\", \"fix\": \"Change 'Robot's' to 'Robots'\"}, {\"span\": \"technology should be used to benefit humans than replacing them\", \"type\": \"incorrect comparative structure\", \"fix\": \"Change 'benefit humans than replacing them' to 'benefit humans rather than replacing them'\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Ensure consistent use of plural forms, e.g., 'robots' instead of 'Robot's'.\", \"Use clearer comparative structures to enhance clarity in arguments.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Lexical Resource\", \"band\": 7.5, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"humans always enjoyed inventions\", \"robots are great electronic devices built with artificial intelligence\", \"humans are irreplaceable\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"every job does by humans\", \"type\": \"grammatical error\", \"fix\": \"every job done by humans\"}, {\"span\": \"Robot's do not have any natural emotions\", \"type\": \"punctuation error\", \"fix\": \"Robots do not have any natural emotions\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Use more varied vocabulary to express ideas, such as synonyms for 'robots' or 'humans' to avoid repetition.\", \"Consider using more complex sentence structures to enhance the sophistication of the writing.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Grammatical Range & Accuracy\", \"band\": 8.5, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"I opine that machines have certain limitations and cannot be replaced easily by humans.\", \"Humans are good at taking a stand based on the situation they are in.\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"every job does by humans\", \"type\": \"word order\", \"fix\": \"every job done by humans\"}, {\"span\": \"Robot's do not have any natural emotions\", \"type\": \"subject-verb agreement\", \"fix\": \"Robots do not have any natural emotions\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Consider varying sentence structures to enhance the overall complexity of the essay.\", \"Ensure subject-verb agreement is maintained throughout the essay.\"]}], \"overall\": 8.0, \"votes\": [8.0, 8.0, 8.0], \"dispersion\": 0.0, \"confidence\": \"high\", \"meta\": {\"prompt_hash\": \"training_data\", \"model\": \"training\", \"schema_version\": \"v1\", \"rubric_version\": \"rubric/v1\", \"token_usage\": {\"input_tokens\": 296, \"output_tokens\": 500}}}"}]}

In the following paragraphs, a number of factors contribute to this trend, and possible ideas to support these people will be outlined.\r\n\r\nTo begin with, the trend of a healthy lifestyle is more common in today’s world. Due to technological development, people can easily access some healthy information about nutrition and physical activities. For example, some articles provide information about how to cook healthy food, making people conveniently follow and cook nutritional meals easier than in the past. Moreover, the Internet can provide information about the correct ways to do some physical activities which people can easily follow to do so.\r\n\r\nProviding functions for physical activities will increase and encourage people to follow this trend. To illustrate, the governments should invest in public parks and gyms which can help people to do more exercise by providing suitable equipment.

Similar to televsion, radio, and the internet, the newspaper is another effective media platform that carries informative news about current happenings locally and internationally, which can broaden readers' visions and open their minds. In addition, the newspaper is beneficial to people who do not have access to other media platforms and can make them equally informed as others. Specifically, people from underdeveloped countries or rural areas where there is a constant interrupting power or internet supply can rely on newspapers as a source of information of ongoing pandemic.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, people can be educated and benefit through newspapers since the material is very reliable. Different from all kinds of posts, videos, and advertisements that pop up on the screen, information from newspapers are more authentic and appropriate since it can be sourced from a specific writer. It is unnecessary to worry about children being misdirected by inappropriate content or elders being deceived by fake posts from newspapers since the authorized publishers are more trustworthy. Moreover, great jobs and scholarships advertised in newspapers can provide people with better career prospects and education opportunities, which can greatly improve readers' lives.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, there is doubt that newspapers can bring enormous positive impacts on humans, as they can widen people's perspectives and spread great opportunities with credible materials.\n\nProvide your assessment in the specified JSON format."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"per_criterion\": [{\"name\": \"Task Response\", \"band\": 7.0, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"this phenomenon is a positive one because it enlightens individuals with happenings around and the globe\", \"the newspaper is a medium through which people can get acquainted with adequate knowledge of what goes around\", \"there is doubt that newspapers can bring enormous positive impacts on humans\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"there is a constant interrupting power or internet supply\", \"type\": \"clarity\", \"fix\": \"there is a constant interruption in power or internet supply\"}, {\"span\": \"information from newspapers are more authentic\", \"type\": \"subject-verb agreement\", \"fix\": \"information from newspapers is more authentic\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Clarify the phrase 'constant interrupting power or internet supply' for better understanding.\", \"Ensure subject-verb agreement throughout the essay, especially with collective nouns.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Coherence & Cohesion\", \"band\": 6.0, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"the newspaper is another effective media platform that carries informative news about current happenings locally and internationally\", \"people can be educated and benefit through newspapers since the material is very reliable\", \"newspapers can bring enormous positive impacts on humans, as they can widen people's perspectives and spread great opportunities\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"information of ongoing pandemic\", \"type\": \"preposition error\", \"fix\": \"change to 'information about the ongoing pandemic'\"}, {\"span\": \"Different from all kinds of posts, videos, and advertisements that pop up on the screen\", \"type\": \"cohesive device error\", \"fix\": \"change to 'Unlike all kinds of posts, videos, and advertisements that pop up on the screen'\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Use clearer cohesive devices to connect ideas, such as 'In contrast' or 'Additionally' to improve flow.\", \"Ensure consistent use of prepositions to enhance clarity, especially when discussing specific topics.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Lexical Resource\", \"band\": 6.0, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"enlightens individuals with happenings around and the globe\", \"can get acquainted with adequate knowledge of what goes around\", \"information from newspapers are more authentic and appropriate\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"information from newspapers are more authentic\", \"type\": \"subject-verb agreement\", \"fix\": \"information from newspapers is more authentic\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Use a wider range of vocabulary to avoid repetition, such as using synonyms for 'information' and 'authentic'.\", \"Ensure subject-verb agreement throughout the essay to enhance grammatical accuracy.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Grammatical Range & Accuracy\", \"band\": 7.0, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"the newspaper is a medium through which people can get acquainted with adequate knowledge of what goes around.\", \"information from newspapers are more authentic and appropriate since it can be sourced from a specific writer.\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"information from newspapers are more authentic\", \"type\": \"subject-verb agreement\", \"fix\": \"information from newspapers is more authentic\"}, {\"span\": \"with happenings around and the globe\", \"type\": \"preposition usage\", \"fix\": \"with happenings around the globe\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Ensure subject-verb agreement is maintained throughout the essay.\", \"Use more varied sentence structures to enhance the overall grammatical range.\"]}], \"overall\": 6.5, \"votes\": [6.5, 6.5, 6.5], \"dispersion\": 0.0, \"confidence\": \"high\", \"meta\": {\"prompt_hash\": \"training_data\", \"model\": \"training\", \"schema_version\": \"v1\", \"rubric_version\": \"rubric/v1\", \"token_usage\": {\"input_tokens\": 302, \"output_tokens\": 500}}}"}]}

Towns and cities should consider public places, such as parks and squares, as important as basic infrastructure like housing and transport system.\n\tThe most obvious benefit of public places like parks and squares, is that they serve as the green lungs of a city. It is widely known that trees filter the air by absorbing carbon dioxide and producing oxygen. Trees also help cool down the temperatures of the environment by increasing air humidity and covering the earth surface from direct sunlight. Thus parks with a lot of trees and green spaces can help clean a city's living environment. \n\tGreen and beautiful places like parks and squares also have good impacts on people's spiritual life. If a person leaves in a house without green space or open air, he or she would be more likely to suffer stress or mental diseases because the living environment is to dull. The same situation can occur in cities that only have roads, buildings, and lack green spaces. Parks and squares are the places where people can hang out and relax. This role is increasingly important in the time of rapid urbanization. Parks and squares are also venues for social events and cultural festivals where people have chances to socialize, make friends, explore new things and thus their spiritual life will be enhanced. These events and festivals, together with parks and squares themselves, are also landmarks that reflect cultural characteristics and history of a city or even a nation. Thus, they can become tourist attractions. All over the world, famous public places have become the symbols of a city and a country, such as the Eiffel Tower in Paris, Central Park in New York, the Harbour Bridge in Sydney or the Sword Lake in Hanoi. All these beautiful places are the first things visitors go to when they arrive in those cities. They greatly contribute to the development of tourism.\n\tIn conclusion, public places such as parks and squares are indispensable parts of towns and cities, contributing to the quality of life, both physically and spiritually.\n\nProvide your assessment in the specified JSON format."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"per_criterion\": [{\"name\": \"Coherence & Cohesion\", \"band\": 6.0, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"The living environment always has profound impacts on life quality of each person and the community as a whole.\", \"Parks and squares are also venues for social events and cultural festivals where people have chances to socialize, make friends, explore new things and thus their spiritual life will be enhanced.\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"the living environment is to dull\", \"type\": \"word choice error\", \"fix\": \"change 'to' to 'too' for correct usage\"}, {\"span\": \"the first things visitors go to when they arrive in those cities\", \"type\": \"reference error\", \"fix\": \"clarify 'those cities' to 'the mentioned cities' for clearer reference\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Use more varied linking words and phrases to improve the flow between ideas.\", \"Ensure all references are clear and specific to avoid confusion for the reader.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Task Response\", \"band\": 6.0, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"Towns and cities should consider public places, such as parks and squares, as important as basic infrastructure like housing and transport system.\", \"Parks and squares are also venues for social events and cultural festivals where people have chances to socialize, make friends, explore new things and thus their spiritual life will be enhanced.\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"the living environment is to dull\", \"type\": \"word choice\", \"fix\": \"the living environment is too dull\"}, {\"span\": \"If a person leaves in a house without green space\", \"type\": \"grammar\", \"fix\": \"If a person lives in a house without green space\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Ensure that all vocabulary is used correctly to improve clarity and precision.\", \"Check for grammatical errors, particularly with verb forms and word choice, to enhance overall fluency.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Lexical Resource\", \"band\": 5.0, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"they serve as the green lungs of a city\", \"good impacts on people's spiritual life\", \"indispensable parts of towns and cities\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"the living environment is to dull\", \"type\": \"word choice\", \"fix\": \"the living environment is too dull\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Use a wider range of vocabulary to express ideas more precisely and avoid repetition.\", \"Incorporate more complex sentence structures to enhance the overall fluency and coherence of the essay.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Grammatical Range & Accuracy\", \"band\": 5.0, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"The living environment always has profound impacts on life quality of each person and the community as a whole.\", \"It is widely known that trees filter the air by absorbing carbon dioxide and producing oxygen.\", \"Parks and squares are also venues for social events and cultural festivals where people have chances to socialize, make friends, explore new things and thus their spiritual life will be enhanced.\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"the living environment is to dull\", \"type\": \"word choice\", \"fix\": \"the living environment is too dull\"}, {\"span\": \"a house without green space or open air\", \"type\": \"article usage\", \"fix\": \"a house without green spaces or open air\"}, {\"span\": \"the Harbour Bridge in Sydney or the Sword Lake in Hanoi\", \"type\": \"parallel structure\", \"fix\": \"the Harbour Bridge in Sydney or Sword Lake in Hanoi\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Use more varied sentence structures to enhance grammatical range.\", \"Pay attention to word choice, particularly with common phrases like 'too' instead of 'to'.\", \"Ensure parallel structure when listing items to improve clarity and coherence.\"]}], \"overall\": 5.5, \"votes\": [5.5, 5.5, 5.5], \"dispersion\": 0.0, \"confidence\": \"high\", \"meta\": {\"prompt_hash\": \"training_data\", \"model\": \"training\", \"schema_version\": \"v1\", \"rubric_version\": \"rubric/v1\", \"token_usage\": {\"input_tokens\": 388, \"output_tokens\": 500}}}"}]}

What problems do you think youth unemployment will cause to the individual and society? Give reasons and make some suggestions.\n\nScore this IELTS Task 2 essay according to the rubric, ensuring alignment with the question:\n\nIt is true that there is a growing number of young individuals leaving school who are unable to find jobs after graduation. This essay will elaborate on the effects including the inability to find suitable candidates for businesses and the financial burden on unemployed people, and suggest some viable solutions consisting of providing education and training programs and learning skills matching.\r\n\r\nThere are two primary impacts caused by the high unemployment rate in young people after graduation. Chief of these is that  businesses are incapable of finding suitable candidates for their positions. Given the fact that there are millions of young individuals graduating and ready for work who lack vital skills that employers need; thereby, a serious decline in young employees in companies is indispensable. Consequently, Older employees will be overloaded when they need to cover more work, leading to a tremendous influence on labour productivity and a reduction of revenue. Furthermore, this phenomenon also causes financial concerns in unemployed individuals. They are unable to afford basic needs such as accommodation and utility bills which make them become a burden to their family due to their dependence on them. \r\n\r\nFortunately, several measures can be taken to alleviate this problem. The first solution would be providing education and training programs. Throughout these programs, young individuals are able to learn crucial skills including employability skills, job hunting, interviewing, entrepreneurship, and vocational education. After being trained and educated by bringing initiatives and extracurricular instruction, young people can specialize in their skills which are essential for their career prospects. The second measure would be training skills matching. The private sector, educators and governments need to start collaborating to determine what knowledge young individuals should be taught in their study programs. Given the fact that businesses are suffering from a skills mismatch; thereby, they need to promote appropriate education and skill-building for young people from an early age. As a result, after young individuals graduate, they are able to find their rewarding work, which helps them reach their maximum potential.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, it is clear that there are numerous influences caused by an immense percentage of unemployment including finding suitable applicants for businesses and financial difficulty for unemployed individuals.

Additionally, the demand of people who are richer than the past is increasing also, for example, the rich citizens can own multiple high-end cell phone or another electric device like iPad or laptops. Consequently, the consumer goods are being produced much more than ever to meet the demand from the countries. \n\nRegarding solutions, there are two ways that the government can take it into consideration to eliminate the issue. Firstly, educating people to have simple living is one of the good ways that the authority should consider, for instance, introducing a simple living style in Japan and its benefit in the online channels. Furthermore, the government should invest more money in the recycling systems, such as paper, water, electric device recycling systems. Those systems definitely help to reduce using the natural resources like wood to produce paper. \n\nIn conclusion, the global population increasing and the demand from the rich people also growing are the main factors for the problem.

Some hold the view that studying in a homogenous setting will have pitfalls in students` future professional and personal life. I completely agree with that belief. \r\n\r\n     One of the main reasons why single-gender institutions are still considered as an effective option for some parents is causing less distraction during the lesson. At some stages of life, especially in teenage period, the young are trying to attract the members of the opposite gender. In the learning process, this sometimes ends up showing low participation and difficulties to concentrate. Another reason is that parents sometimes find separate schools for boys and girls much safer places. As there are fewer chances for contradictions which lead to bad behaviour in this kind of academies. In other words, children studying in homogenous schools have less discipline issues. \r\n\r\n    On the other hand, some detrimental effects of exclusive schools for boys and girls are supposed to be seen in other spheres of the learners` life. In the society, people have to contact and communicate with a number of people from the opposite gender. If they grow up without interacting with both of the sexes, they will encounter a lot of problems in terms of communication in a workplace, at home, university or office. Furthermore, it is proved that men`s and women`s brains work differently that can be effective while learning. They can share different perspectives with each other and build the skills of cooperation. \r\n\r\nIn conclusion, our modern world requires strong communication skills that single-sex institutions cannot provide.

For instance, well-renowned colleges, such as that in Oxford or Yale, have had a tradition to come  withtogether a studentship , deepen their roots into national government and international politics. All in all, one of the major pluses of being educated formally is to obtain useful links with exposure to exclusive and highly prestigious spheres.\n\nSecondly, among the number of negative sides is a practical inability to being admitted to top-notch international firms because of necessary skillset miss. The point is that universities help to gain skills needed for attaining an internship and become more experienced, thus pretending on higher positions within a company's hierarchy. For example, there is no room for analysts in investment banking or consulting firms , which stand apart from other career paths as the most desirable and lucrative, without any relevant experience in the field.

Although, in mi opinion, second view is reasonable.\r\n\r\n One the one hand, there are several reasons that lead people to believe that juvenile crime. One of them is that kids or teenagers need to be responible for what they have done, especially breaking the laws. Moreover, if the punishment applies to young people, they will remember and will not be reoffended. For example, criminals can use children to rob a bank, and the police will see the issue that the kid is breaking the rule. However, they will pass this problem because they are just children. \r\n\r\n On the other hand, I strongly believe that in serious crimes parents should be punished instead because the child is not well educated about laws.

I  disagree with this view as the benefits outweigh disadvantages To begin with, if juveniles are required to volunteer for unpaid neighbourhood services, some  people think that it would enhance their feeling of empathy towards mankind and nature. As  the youngster is highly impressionable, working for the neighbourhood will turn them into socially  responsible adults. So, for the benefit of the district and youth, teenagers must be  encouraged to occupy themselves with  voluntary jobs in their free time.  However, children between thirteen and nineteen years of age are fragile and through  neighbourhood task, they have to dig deep into the harsh realities of life such as hunger and  poverty. This could adversely affect their young conscience and they would be carrying the  the negative image of society in their minds throughout their lives. Also, if the job is unpaid,  there is a lack of motivation as well because if they are not paid for their efforts, they may get  discouraged to participate in future. For example, many children are devastated when they  interact with the deprived segment of the society and sometimes this leads to serious  cognitive issues like depression and phobia of meeting new people. Therefore, it should not  be mandatory for the juvenile to take part in unpaid social work in their free time.  To conclude, although unpaid public service is a noble act, youth should not be  compelled to engage in it until they are ready because it exposes them to the harsh realities  of life.

Nowadays, this generation tend to have children at an older age because many believe that at such time they would have had wealth of experience and might have saved enough resources to take care of their young. Notwithstanding the challenges of conception  they would face, the merits of that decision outweigh the demerits. \r\n\r\nTo start with, although at a much younger age, it is easier to conceive and give birth with little or no complication with regard to grown adults which in most cases would have to go through a lot of treatment and medication in order for them to have babies however, older folks do have the skills and knowledge in raising a child. For example, my mom had my elder sibling and I at 40 years. By then she alone babysitted us with no assistance from her parents or neighbours.

To what extent do you agree or disagree?\n\nScore this IELTS Task 2 essay according to the rubric, ensuring alignment with the question:\n\nAfter graduating, many people look for a job. Sometimes they want to work in their passion while others do not take passion as an important thing but the experience and how it can support their lives. Admittedly, the work may be difficult to follow in the beginning but over  time workers can feel the enjoyment because they get the pattern for their work. Therefore, I completely disagree with that statement.\r\n\r\nTo begin with, these days getting a passion work is not easy since there are plenty of people looking for the job as well. For example, fresh undergraduate students try to get work as same as their excitement but it takes some time. While waiting for their feedback application, undoubtedly, they need funds as well to buy their pieces of stuff. Moreover, if they ignored their tasks when they were already in the work environment, it would jeopardise them since they would not get any promotion or trust from the company.\r\n\r\nAnother point to consider is working in different areas sometimes can expand more experiences as well as networking. At first, staff may be hard to start when they have no intention of carrying out the job. For instance, someone who has an undergraduate in design and has passion in that area surprisingly accepts a job in a different area as public relations. In her new field, she has to take more time to learn but as time goes by she finally enjoys it and scales up the experience in that field. In addition, when people accept a job, they are used to knowing  their responsibilities, so it is unacceptable if they do not want to perform just because they do not feel joy in it.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, working with the same passion might be the dream for everyone whereas these days people have to compete with each other to get the job, as a blue-collar or white-collar. I disagree with the statement because employees have to fulfil their tasks which contribute to the company’s goal despite of like or dislike since they already sign the contract with the company.

Others, however think that this money would be better spent on health and education. To what extent do you agree or disagree with these opinions? Discuss, based on your knowledge and experience.\n\nScore this IELTS Task 2 essay according to the rubric, ensuring alignment with the question:\n\nSome people adhere to the opinion that governments should financially support arts and other related activities and programmes. They feel that art enormously influences the society by transforming point of views, instilling values and interpreting experiences. Moreover, they also think that it significantly affects the fundamental sense of self.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, they argue that arts preserve history by reminiscing an experience in a particular time and place. This can be evidenced by the massive number of paintings, sculptures, songs, literary works and other crafts, which are frequently considered as the repository of the collective memory of a society. Additionally, some researchers conducted a study of the relationship between the arts and the brain. They discovered that visual art observations had constructive effects on the personal lives of the nursing home-bound elders. In addition to this, arts can be an important key in a community's economic development. To illustrate, the arts and cultural industries provide employments, attract investors and stimulate local economies through tourism, consumer purchases and tax revenues. \r\n\r\nConversely, in spite of the contributions of arts in the society, I believe that national funds should be focusing more on health and education sectors. Without a doubt, a nation can only be sustained if its citizens are well-educated and holistically healthy and fit. For instance, with the tremendous global modernization, people of various nationalities should be globally competitive enough to catch up with vast technological innovations, which are being used by large companies; so as to strengthen their workforce. Another example would be the fact that, currently, countries all over the world are in a race to purchase millions of vaccines for a particular viral disease. For this reason, governments are now allocating billions of dollars to have their vulnerable citizens vaccinated as soon as possible. Ultimately, with sufficient subsidization on health and education, societies can have lower crime rates, better overall health and civic involvement.\r\n\r\nTo sum up, arts are indeed a noteworthy representation of a country, which also aid in economic development.

Discuss both sides and give your opinion.\n\nScore this IELTS Task 2 essay according to the rubric, ensuring alignment with the question:\n\nA highly controversial issue today relates to whether any knowledge gained is a waste. A particular population group believes that art is an important course for offspring at school while others think otherwise. In the essay, I will be looking at both points of view and explain why I believe that craft is essential knowledge.\r\n\r\nTo begin with, there are a number of arguments in support of my stance, the most preponderant is that evidently, what kids learn while growing up sharpens their behaviour and also has an effect on their career choices. For example, in developed countries like the US, someone can find special profession classes to enrol their children like ballet, gymnastics, and many more. As a result, these folks with early training turn out to be future world champions in these areas.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, It can as well be seen as a waste of time for parents who already have plans for their offspring. Clearly, this set of people aspires for their children to end up with professional careers like medical doctors, lawyers, engineers and all what not.

In other words, each individual has a private life irrespective of  one's level of popularity in society, where one can live as an ordinary individual. For instance, most of the time, news channels broadcast news about the clips shared by popular personalities on their social media accounts, without taking their consent. Henceforth, anyone can mind, if someone publicizes their personal information, just because of its availability and accessibility on social media platforms.\r\n\r\nMoreover, when media reporters try to chase them everywhere, it disturbs their mental peace. After obtaining data about famous person from radio, television and other information sources, general public usually try to follow them too, which is unjustifiable for celebrities, as they may find hard to spend some personal time with their families. To exemplify, when celebrities take some time off from their work to go on vacation, news media usually reaches there too, just to capture their personal movements to get some views, likes and comments on their channel. Thus, this kind of act may distress celebrities more, as it can break their family.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, an abovementioned facts substantiates that irresponsible behavior of media could affect celebrities life and mental health adversely.

Discuss both views and give your opinion.\n\nScore this IELTS Task 2 essay according to the rubric, ensuring alignment with the question:\n\nThere has been much discussion revolving around the issue of whether students should focus on further education in universities and colleges or it is better to let them apply for a job straight after school. In this essay I am going to present both views and give my opinion. \n\nSome people tend to think that it is better to continue your education in higher institutions, because of the higher employment opportunities. One of the first things we need to take into consideration is that universities and colleges give you more understanding and knowledge in the sphere you are studying in, that helps you become a better specialist and most of the employers search for well trained workers. For example, nurses and dentists are required to have special training, which can take for about ten years, without it they won’t even be able to become a simple doctor. But not only students of medical specialisations take further education, designers, managers, writers and others do it too, that’s because often students don’t have enough knowledge to start their career, but with the help of professors, they have a lot more chances to become professionals and it will be easier for them to get a job. \n\nHowever, others insist that it’s better to get a job, because you can earn money and not spend it on expensive learning. For instance, university prices go higher every year which is not affordable for every family to let their children apply for one, so as we can see from the last trends, it becomes more common for students to start their own business, build career as a photographer, freelancer or etc. and make good money out of it.\n\nTo conclude, I consider learning at high education institutions is a good base for future career and improvement students will get is indispensable, but in my opinion it is not a necessity and it would be nicer to put less pressure on those, who have chosen not to take this path and got a job straight after school.\n\nProvide your assessment in the specified JSON format."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"per_criterion\": [{\"name\": \"Task Response\", \"band\": 6.5, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"In this essay I am going to present both views and give my opinion.\", \"I consider learning at high education institutions is a good base for future career and improvement students will get is indispensable.\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"it is better to let them apply for a job straight after school\", \"type\": \"clarity\", \"fix\": \"rephrase to clarify that it refers to entering the workforce immediately after high school\"}, {\"span\": \"that helps you become a better specialist and most of the employers search for well trained workers\", \"type\": \"grammar\", \"fix\": \"correct to 'which helps you become a better specialist, and most employers search for well-trained workers.'\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Provide a clearer distinction between the two views in the introduction.\", \"Strengthen the conclusion by summarizing the key points made in the essay.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Coherence & Cohesion\", \"band\": 5.5, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"In this essay I am going to present both views and give my opinion.\", \"To conclude, I consider learning at high education institutions is a good base for future career and improvement students will get is indispensable.\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"but with the help of professors, they have a lot more chances to become professionals\", \"type\": \"lack of clarity\", \"fix\": \"Rephrase to clarify the subject of 'they' and ensure it is clear that it refers to students.\"}, {\"span\": \"which can take for about ten years, without it they won’t even be able to become a simple doctor.\", \"type\": \"sentence structure\", \"fix\": \"Rephrase to improve clarity, such as 'which can take about ten years; without this training, they cannot even become a basic doctor.'\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Use clearer subject references to avoid ambiguity, particularly in complex sentences.\", \"Improve sentence structure for better flow and readability, ensuring that each sentence logically follows the previous one.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Lexical Resource\", \"band\": 5.5, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"higher employment opportunities\", \"more understanding and knowledge in the sphere you are studying in\", \"learning at high education institutions is a good base for future career\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"that helps you become a better specialist\", \"type\": \"word choice\", \"fix\": \"that helps you become a better professional\"}, {\"span\": \"build career as a photographer, freelancer or etc.\", \"type\": \"incorrect phrase\", \"fix\": \"build a career as a photographer, freelancer, etc.\"}, {\"span\": \"improvement students will get is indispensable\", \"type\": \"grammar\", \"fix\": \"the improvement that students will get is indispensable\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Use a wider range of vocabulary to express ideas more precisely.\", \"Avoid informal phrases and ensure correct grammatical structures.\", \"Practice using synonyms to replace common words and phrases for variety.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Grammatical Range & Accuracy\", \"band\": 6.5, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"Some people tend to think that it is better to continue your education in higher institutions, because of the higher employment opportunities.\", \"To conclude, I consider learning at high education institutions is a good base for future career and improvement students will get is indispensable.\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"it would be nicer to put less pressure on those, who have chosen not to take this path\", \"type\": \"comma splice\", \"fix\": \"remove the comma before 'who'\"}, {\"span\": \"which can take for about ten years\", \"type\": \"preposition error\", \"fix\": \"change 'for' to 'about'\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Vary sentence structures by using more complex sentences and conjunctions to enhance the grammatical range.\", \"Pay attention to the use of prepositions and commas to improve overall accuracy.\"]}], \"overall\": 6.0, \"votes\": [6.0, 6.0, 6.0], \"dispersion\": 0.0, \"confidence\": \"high\", \"meta\": {\"prompt_hash\": \"training_data\", \"model\": \"training\", \"schema_version\": \"v1\", \"rubric_version\": \"rubric/v1\", \"token_usage\": {\"input_tokens\": 378, \"output_tokens\": 500}}}"}]}

Do the advantages of this outweigh the disadvantages?\n\nScore this IELTS Task 2 essay according to the rubric, ensuring alignment with the question:\n\nIn the world today people tend  to give birth and start families at a later stage in their lives. From my own point of perspective, the merits outweigh the demerits because there might be unpalatable consequences resulting from this such as difficulty  in conceiving a child.\r\n\r\nTo begin with, Despite these disadvantages, there are certain benefits which can be encapsulated under the umbrella of stability, both: financial and familial. As a couple progresses in life they should have greater financial resources to draw upon to support their children and reduce the negative impact on poverty. In addition to the financial stability, there’s also stability in the family which should increase as the couple matures. As a result, children born at a later stage are less vulnerable to the negative consequences of divorce and family break up which are less common in older pairings.\r\n\r\nAlthough the positive aspects appear to have great strength, there are also significant negative factors to consider. Foremost, as people age, they suffer from a greater amount of genetic degradation which can increase the chances of having a child with a genetic defect such as Down's syndrome. Another factor which can have a detrimental effect on a child’s quality of growth is the fact that older people tend to have less energy which means they are less able to cope with and raise their relatively more energetic young child. Moreso, there is also a generation gap in terms of relatability. As the age gap between the child and the parents increases their ability to relate to each other and share the same ideas about life could be placed under severe pressure. This may have negative consequences on the child’s upbringing and development. For instance, there could be numerous intra-family conflicts between youngsters and their elderly parents.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, given the greater number of negative elements in comparison to the smaller number of positive aspects of giving birth at an older stage in life, it is reasonable to conclude that it is more beneficial to conceive and raise children at a relatively earlier age.\n\nProvide your assessment in the specified JSON format."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"per_criterion\": [{\"name\": \"Task Response\", \"band\": 8.0, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"the merits outweigh the demerits because there might be unpalatable consequences resulting from this such as difficulty in conceiving a child.\", \"there are certain benefits which can be encapsulated under the umbrella of stability, both: financial and familial.\", \"it is reasonable to conclude that it is more beneficial to conceive and raise children at a relatively earlier age.\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"the merits outweigh the demerits because there might be unpalatable consequences resulting from this\", \"type\": \"clarity\", \"fix\": \"Clarify the relationship between merits and demerits; consider rephrasing to explicitly state the positive aspects.\"}, {\"span\": \"the greater number of negative elements in comparison to the smaller number of positive aspects\", \"type\": \"coherence\", \"fix\": \"Rephrase to avoid ambiguity; specify what the negative and positive aspects are for clearer comparison.\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Provide more specific examples of both the merits and demerits to strengthen the argument.\", \"Ensure that the conclusion clearly summarizes the key points made in the body paragraphs for better coherence.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Coherence & Cohesion\", \"band\": 7.0, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"the merits outweigh the demerits because there might be unpalatable consequences resulting from this such as difficulty in conceiving a child.\", \"there are certain benefits which can be encapsulated under the umbrella of stability, both: financial and familial.\", \"given the greater number of negative elements in comparison to the smaller number of positive aspects of giving birth at an older stage in life\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"Despite these disadvantages\", \"type\": \"cohesive device error\", \"fix\": \"Change to 'Despite these advantages' to maintain coherence with the preceding sentence.\"}, {\"span\": \"Moreso\", \"type\": \"informal language\", \"fix\": \"Replace 'Moreso' with 'Moreover' for a more formal tone.\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Ensure that transitions between ideas are clear and logically connected to enhance the flow of the essay.\", \"Use more formal language and avoid colloquialisms to improve the academic tone of the essay.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Lexical Resource\", \"band\": 7.0, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"the merits outweigh the demerits\", \"encapsulated under the umbrella of stability\", \"genetic degradation\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"Moreso\", \"type\": \"word choice\", \"fix\": \"Moreover\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Use a wider range of synonyms to avoid repetition, such as using 'advantages' instead of 'benefits' or 'positive aspects'.\", \"Incorporate more complex phrases and idioms to enhance the richness of the vocabulary.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Grammatical Range & Accuracy\", \"band\": 8.0, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"the merits outweigh the demerits because there might be unpalatable consequences resulting from this such as difficulty in conceiving a child.\", \"there are certain benefits which can be encapsulated under the umbrella of stability, both: financial and familial.\", \"As a result, children born at a later stage are less vulnerable to the negative consequences of divorce and family break up which are less common in older pairings.\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"Despite these disadvantages\", \"type\": \"punctuation\", \"fix\": \"Despite these disadvantages,\"}, {\"span\": \"Moreso\", \"type\": \"word choice\", \"fix\": \"Moreover,\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Ensure proper punctuation is used, especially after transitional phrases.\", \"Consider using more precise vocabulary to enhance clarity and coherence.\"]}], \"overall\": 7.5, \"votes\": [7.5, 7.5, 7.5], \"dispersion\": 0.0, \"confidence\": \"high\", \"meta\": {\"prompt_hash\": \"training_data\", \"model\": \"training\", \"schema_version\": \"v1\", \"rubric_version\": \"rubric/v1\", \"token_usage\": {\"input_tokens\": 363, \"output_tokens\": 500}}}"}]}

One evident strength is that prisons are important places that play a significant role in making sure  social security. In prisons, there is a host of policemen who assumes the responsibility of capturing criminals and giving out some reasonable punishments to punish them. Especially for dangerous lawbreakers such as rapists or murders have to receive the death penalty or be sentenced to jail for a long time to warn them. In other words, If a nation doesn’t have imprisonment for those committing felonies, there will be  thousands of people are able to be killed annually. Take Vietnam as a good example, thanks to enacting life imprisonment, the number of crimes declined considerably.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, there also have good education programmes which the authorities enact to guarantee that prisoners have a keen knowledge of social life and perceive what is morally right or wrong to steer clear of offending the crime down the road. Furthermore, they also sharpen some important skills and have vocational training to help them to remake their lives. In fact, they could make a living to alleviate the financial burden for their families. Contrarily, if they are just received wonderful education after committing the crime, they could not have the hands-on knowledge to find a job.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, Although it offers lots of

What are the causes of this?

However, whether they contribute to the development of the future of mankind or pose a danger to mankind is still debated. In the following paragraphs, I will elaborate on both views and present my own position on the issue.\n\nOn the one hand, people are afraid of robots due to a large number of failures. In fact, it is sometimes impossible to explain and understand the robot's behaviour, so engineers cannot fully trust the machine. For example, explaining AI predictions in high-stakes fields like medicine is critical because it helps humans rely on those predictions. That said  if people trust the machines, when the robots malfunction, it could lead to false cancer detections. I acknowledge these serious concerns about bots, but I still believe that a well-organized pipeline of experts and AI will minimize failures.\n\nOn the other hand, we already use robots in our daily life. As long as we use personal computers, we use artificial intelligence applications unconsciously. For example, weather forecasts are based on artificial intelligence, and in addition, product recommendations are also based on artificial intelligence.

Similar goods and products are available all over the world via e-commerce websites and offline markets. In this essay, we will discuss both positive and negative aspects of it.\r\n\r\nTo begin with, international trade has increased exponentially in the last 2 decades due to technological advancement and brand establishments. Big brands like Zara, Gucci and Prada have their presence across the globe. Their stores can be found in almost all the countries. Just like this brand's, there are many other brand's which are available across the globe. Due to globalisation, it has become convenient for buyers to buy products of international brands in their own country. Initially, only people who could afford to travel to different countries were able to buy international products. However, now the scenario has changed and many of this brand's shops are available in almost all the countries where people can buy them offline or they can order them online.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, there are a few negative aspects of having similar shops and products in different countries. First, there is no diversity in designs. Similar designs can be found in different countries. Second, countries lack the authenticity of their local products as they are available or listed on platforms like amazon which allows sellers to sell products internationally. For example, recently one of my colleagues had visited Paris for her vacation. she wanted to do some shopping in Paris however, she could not find any unique design which she can buy as a souvenir. Those same shops and designs were also available in her home country with a minimal variation in price.\r\n\r\nTo sum up, there are many benefits which surpass the negative aspects of having similar shops across the globe as this give a homelike feeling to someone who is planning to stay in a different country for months or years.\n\nProvide your assessment in the specified JSON format."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"per_criterion\": [{\"name\": \"Task Response\", \"band\": 8.0, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"we will discuss both positive and negative aspects of it\", \"there are many benefits which surpass the negative aspects of having similar shops across the globe\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"Just like this brand's, there are many other brand's which are available across the globe.\", \"type\": \"grammatical error\", \"fix\": \"Change 'brand's' to 'brands' to correct the possessive form.\"}, {\"span\": \"she wanted to do some shopping in Paris however, she could not find any unique design which she can buy as a souvenir.\", \"type\": \"punctuation error\", \"fix\": \"Add a comma before 'however' to separate the clauses.\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Provide more specific examples of both positive and negative aspects to strengthen the argument.\", \"Clarify the conclusion by summarizing the key points discussed in the essay.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Coherence & Cohesion\", \"band\": 7.0, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"To begin with, international trade has increased exponentially in the last 2 decades due to technological advancement and brand establishments.\", \"To sum up, there are many benefits which surpass the negative aspects of having similar shops across the globe as this give a homelike feeling to someone who is planning to stay in a different country for months or years.\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"Just like this brand's, there are many other brand's which are available across the globe.\", \"type\": \"grammatical error\", \"fix\": \"Correct 'brand's' to 'brands' for proper pluralization.\"}, {\"span\": \"she wanted to do some shopping in Paris however, she could not find any unique design which she can buy as a souvenir.\", \"type\": \"punctuation error\", \"fix\": \"Add a period or semicolon before 'however' to separate the two independent clauses.\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Use clearer transitions between ideas to enhance the flow of the essay.\", \"Ensure proper pluralization and grammatical accuracy to maintain clarity.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Lexical Resource\", \"band\": 7.0, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"international trade has increased exponentially in the last 2 decades due to technological advancement and brand establishments\", \"it has become convenient for buyers to buy products of international brands in their own country\", \"there are many benefits which surpass the negative aspects of having similar shops across the globe\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"Just like this brand's, there are many other brand's which are available across the globe\", \"type\": \"possessive form error\", \"fix\": \"Just like these brands, there are many other brands which are available across the globe\"}, {\"span\": \"this give a homelike feeling\", \"type\": \"subject-verb agreement error\", \"fix\": \"this gives a homelike feeling\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Use a wider range of vocabulary to express ideas more precisely and avoid repetition.\", \"Ensure correct grammatical structures, especially with possessive forms and subject-verb agreement.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Grammatical Range & Accuracy\", \"band\": 8.0, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"international trade has increased exponentially in the last 2 decades due to technological advancement and brand establishments.\", \"Due to globalisation, it has become convenient for buyers to buy products of international brands in their own country.\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"Just like this brand's, there are many other brand's which are available across the globe.\", \"type\": \"possessive error\", \"fix\": \"Just like this brand, there are many other brands which are available across the globe.\"}, {\"span\": \"she wanted to do some shopping in Paris however, she could not find any unique design which she can buy as a souvenir.\", \"type\": \"punctuation error\", \"fix\": \"she wanted to do some shopping in Paris; however, she could not find any unique design which she could buy as a souvenir.\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Vary sentence structures to enhance the complexity of the writing.\", \"Ensure consistent use of verb tenses, especially when discussing past experiences.\"]}], \"overall\": 7.5, \"votes\": [7.5, 7.5, 7.5], \"dispersion\": 0.0, \"confidence\": \"high\", \"meta\": {\"prompt_hash\": \"training_data\", \"model\": \"training\", \"schema_version\": \"v1\", \"rubric_version\": \"rubric/v1\", \"token_usage\": {\"input_tokens\": 347, \"output_tokens\": 500}}}"}]}

In this essay, i am going to explain both views and draw my conclusion.\r\n\r\nIn terms of increase the price of fuel for transport is one of the best solutions to decrease the ratio of car pollution. The main reason to support this claim is, people will lead to used other transport instead of cars to preserve their money. To illustrate people will prefer utility transport with no fuel and low prices such as, electric cars or bicycles. in other words, the proportion of disease distribution it will disappear with time because of these healthy alternatives.\r\n\r\nIn another hand, this solution is not adaptable in some countries.

Firstly, this method may decrease fuel vehicle usage and ownership. If the price of fuel, which is needed for cars to activate, people tend to swift to transportation that requires less fuel such as buses or bicycles. In 2022, many surveys have indicated that since the cost of fuel peaked after 20 years due to the war, the rate of people taking public transportation and riding bicycles increased. Secondly, higher fuel charges might lessen the exploitation. When rising the fuel price, many companies lost their interest in  investing in the process of utilizing fossil fuel. Therefore, fewer and fewer minerals may be made use of and also devoted to preserving the variety of the world's minerals. \r\n\r\nDespite the aforementioned benefits, I believe that some other measures can be adopted to address ecological issues.

The government, having the highest authority, has a pivotal role in regulating supply of houses to citizens. Thus, I firmly believe it is only through government led movement that alleviation of the problem could be realised.\r\n\r\nSome may propose that land developers and citizens have a role in aggravating the housing problems: developers can accelerate the process of building housing estates, while citizens can move to areas further away from city centre to reduce the congestion. Of course, these would rely on their conscience, which is often lacking. Who wouldn’t want to live in the proximity of their workplace or school, with all the shops and daily necessities in place? My friend, for instance, prefered to live in Sydney in a tiny flat as she felt it was extremely convenient, rather than go back to suburban areas which was remote and isolated. With the government’s policy in place, giving monetary incentives or welfare rewards to those who comply with increasing residential supply, the scheme would be much more efficient.\r\n\r\nIt is crystal clear that the government has the highest power to enact changes in society. They can design policies to ensure adequate supply of land is provided for residential use, as well as putting a limit to the population rise, therefore reaching a balance between man and space. Singapore is a glaring example, where the authorities have put together reasonably priced and spacious public housing estates for its citizens in the past decades, relieving the pressure on living space. Hong Kong, on the contrary, without such large scale public housing plans in place, finds itself constantly lacking in quality apartments to house the needy. \r\n\r\nWithout the officials led change, it is extremely difficult and inefficient to ease the pressure on housing supply.

However ,some opine that the time of watching TV could affecting. From my point of ,view, I believe that television is the most dangerous instrument for changing child behaviour. \r\n\r\nFirstly ,in my ,opinion, watching TV  is not suitable for children. For example ,in most countries around the world ,all offsprings have a noticeable desire to watch diverse programmes on television such as action movies ,TV shows and animations. Because of having a strong imagination among the young ,generation, they commence to imitate from these and play the roles. There is no denying that this could cause changes in scions treatment. Therefore ,this makes it clear the reasons  those who do not accept TV is appropriate.\r\n\r\nBy contrast ,others believe that scion should watch television but not for a long time. For instance ,most parents legislate this rule at their home that their offspring could watch programmes on television for about 2 hours per day. These people claim by conducting this we can monitor our child's behaviour also the negative impact of watching TV start to reduce to observe this rule by scions. This would create a space for doing assignments also playing with siblings by their toys. In addition to conducting this activity by parents the quantity of reading books to be increased.

This essay will discuss both views and end with a reasoned conclusion, also a statement that some viable steps can improve the situation.\r\n\r\nFirstly, in the revolution of industrialisation, humans built lots of factories and farms. Moreover, these create a high level of carbon emission which is highly hazardous for species and natural resources. Already, the global warming has reached much closer to the peak. Similarly, It has increased desertification at a very high rate. Furthermore, river and sea water has been polluted by humans which is causing an upward death rate of birds and animals. Also, it is very hard to find proper and pure soil for farming crops, while the world population is increasing day by day as well as food consumption. In addition, the carbon emission rate is growing every year due to the increased usage of fossil fuel-powered transportation, aeroplanes and factories. However, these activities are leading to another massive greenhouse event which may dissolve all the species on the surface of the planet. \r\n\r\nConversely, against all these measures, some government-sponsored activities can still improve the situation. For example, the EU has announced that within the year 2025, all fuel-powered cars will be converted to  electric-powered ones. Meanwhile, renewable energy has been promoted to users around the world namely, solar power, hydroelectric plants, biogas etc. The government should educate people regarding proper waste management and build awareness which can change the situation towards happiness. \r\n\r\nIn conclusion, from the beginning of human civilization, lots of damage has been done.

What are the causes of this and what actions can be taken to solve this problem?\n\nScore this IELTS Task 2 essay according to the rubric, ensuring alignment with the question:\n\nNowadays everyone has a vehicle. The increasing number of vehicles on the road is a major problem in many cities and towns. This essay intends to analyze the reasons for this phenomenon, and also suggest some solutions to tackle the situation.\r\n\r\nTo begin with, although there is a myriad of reasons behind this issue, the first and foremost reason is poor public transportation. To explain it more, people avoid using public transport because of lack of frequency, poor interior, sitting and many other facilities by which individuals choose to private vehicle for going to work place and daily routine. Secondly, nowadays it is easy to buy a car and maintain it. Banks and financial companies give the best offers to consumers in low instalments. Due to that, every family has 2 or more cars without necessity. For instance, Ratan Tata, Founder of Tata Company, launched a budget-friendly car for middle-class families under 1 lakh only. As a result, people crossed the limit and the results were seen on the roads.\r\n\r\nHowever, The solutions do not mitigate the problem but changes will be seen definitely. Firstly, Governments should give facilities for public transport by which people are attracted to ride once in a bus or train. To elaborate it, Authorities should give proper timing schedules to customers so that the masses do not waste their time on stations. They want to provide some discount offers such as If a person buys a monthly pass, they can get a 30% discount on the total. In addition to this, the Road transport department should make highways which are not connected to city traffic. They should improve road conditions which was the best way to solve this problem.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, although traffic problems in many cities and towns through various reasons of over cars, and poor public transport, we can solve this issue by improving roads, and public transport, and giving discounts.\n\nProvide your assessment in the specified JSON format."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"per_criterion\": [{\"name\": \"Task Response\", \"band\": 7.0, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"the first and foremost reason is poor public transportation\", \"Governments should give facilities for public transport by which people are attracted to ride once in a bus or train\", \"we can solve this issue by improving roads, and public transport, and giving discounts\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"by which individuals choose to private vehicle for going to work place\", \"type\": \"clarity\", \"fix\": \"by which individuals choose private vehicles for going to their workplaces\"}, {\"span\": \"the results were seen on the roads\", \"type\": \"vagueness\", \"fix\": \"the negative effects were evident in increased traffic congestion\"}, {\"span\": \"which was the best way to solve this problem\", \"type\": \"tense consistency\", \"fix\": \"which is the best way to solve this problem\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Clarify statements by providing specific examples or data to support claims.\", \"Ensure consistency in verb tense throughout the essay.\", \"Use more precise language to describe the effects of the issues discussed.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Coherence & Cohesion\", \"band\": 6.0, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"the first and foremost reason is poor public transportation\", \"Governments should give facilities for public transport by which people are attracted to ride once in a bus or train\", \"we can solve this issue by improving roads, and public transport, and giving discounts\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"by which individuals choose to private vehicle for going to work place and daily routine\", \"type\": \"grammatical error\", \"fix\": \"by which individuals choose private vehicles for going to their workplaces and daily routines\"}, {\"span\": \"the Road transport department should make highways which are not connected to city traffic\", \"type\": \"clarity issue\", \"fix\": \"the Road Transport Department should construct highways that are separate from city traffic\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Use clearer transitions between ideas to enhance the flow of the essay.\", \"Ensure grammatical accuracy to improve clarity and coherence in sentences.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Lexical Resource\", \"band\": 6.0, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"the increasing number of vehicles on the road is a major problem\", \"poor public transportation\", \"the masses do not waste their time on stations\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"choose to private vehicle for going to work place\", \"type\": \"word choice\", \"fix\": \"choose a private vehicle for going to the workplace\"}, {\"span\": \"which was the best way to solve this problem\", \"type\": \"tense error\", \"fix\": \"which is the best way to solve this problem\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Use more varied vocabulary to express ideas, such as synonyms for 'problem' and 'solution'.\", \"Ensure correct grammatical structures, especially with articles and prepositions.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Grammatical Range & Accuracy\", \"band\": 7.0, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"the first and foremost reason is poor public transportation\", \"Governments should give facilities for public transport by which people are attracted to ride once in a bus or train\", \"the Road transport department should make highways which are not connected to city traffic\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"by which individuals choose to private vehicle\", \"type\": \"preposition error\", \"fix\": \"by which individuals choose to use a private vehicle\"}, {\"span\": \"which was the best way to solve this problem\", \"type\": \"tense error\", \"fix\": \"which is the best way to solve this problem\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Vary sentence structures by incorporating more complex sentences and clauses.\", \"Ensure consistent verb tenses throughout the essay to maintain clarity.\"]}], \"overall\": 6.5, \"votes\": [6.5, 6.5, 6.5], \"dispersion\": 0.0, \"confidence\": \"high\", \"meta\": {\"prompt_hash\": \"training_data\", \"model\": \"training\", \"schema_version\": \"v1\", \"rubric_version\": \"rubric/v1\", \"token_usage\": {\"input_tokens\": 350, \"output_tokens\": 500}}}"}]}

To what extent do you agree or disagree?\n\nScore this IELTS Task 2 essay according to the rubric, ensuring alignment with the question:\n\nThe assertion that team sports are the best method to teach youngsters how to cooperate is a viewpoint that has gained considerable attention. Although team sports can indeed foster collaboration skills, I believe that there are other effective avenues for teaching cooperation as well.\r\n\r\nEssentially, team sports are very efficient when it comes to teaching young people how to cooperate with each other. Through a competitive environment, teenagers develop teamwork skills, self-esteem and strategising. For example, students can have many opportunities to recognise the strengths as well as the shortcomings of each teammate which can be used to better compete against their opponents, especially in sports with more than 5 participants such as football, volleyball and basketball. Additionally, playing sports also stimulates a working environment where people work towards a common goal together. Thus, pupils learn how to work together more effectively when they engage in these sporting activities.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, it is important to recognize that cooperation skills can be cultivated through a range of activities beyond team sports. Firstly, cooperative learning strategies in classrooms, group projects, community service activities and even creative pursuits like theatre or music can also provide valuable opportunities for young adults to develop collaboration skills. In fact, these activities promote cooperation, and the ability to work effectively in a group setting. They encourage the youth to understand diverse perspectives, value teamwork and appreciate the benefit of collective effort. Secondly, not all offspring may be inclined toward or have the opportunity to participate in team sports. Thus, it is essential to provide a range of activities and environments that cater to diverse interests or abilities, ensuring that all youngsters have a chance to develop their cooperation skills.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, while team sports offer valuable opportunities for teaching offspring to cooperate, I believe that cooperation skills can be developed through a variety of activities and environments. By providing a balanced approach that includes all activities, we can effectively nurture the value and skill of cooperation in adolescents.\n\nProvide your assessment in the specified JSON format."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"per_criterion\": [{\"name\": \"Task Response\", \"band\": 7.5, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"team sports can indeed foster collaboration skills\", \"cooperation skills can be cultivated through a range of activities beyond team sports\", \"it is essential to provide a range of activities and environments that cater to diverse interests or abilities\"], \"errors\": [], \"suggestions\": [\"Consider providing more specific examples of non-sport activities that teach cooperation to strengthen the argument.\", \"Expand on the conclusion to summarize key points more effectively and reinforce the main argument.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Coherence & Cohesion\", \"band\": 6.5, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"team sports can indeed foster collaboration skills\", \"cooperation skills can be cultivated through a range of activities beyond team sports\", \"it is essential to provide a range of activities and environments that cater to diverse interests or abilities\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"students can have many opportunities to recognise the strengths as well as the shortcomings of each teammate\", \"type\": \"clarity\", \"fix\": \"Consider rephrasing to clarify that this recognition occurs during gameplay.\"}, {\"span\": \"the youth to understand diverse perspectives, value teamwork and appreciate the benefit of collective effort\", \"type\": \"parallel structure\", \"fix\": \"Ensure parallel structure in the list: 'understand diverse perspectives, value teamwork, and appreciate the benefits of collective efforts.'\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Use more linking words or phrases to connect ideas between sentences and paragraphs for better flow.\", \"Ensure that lists maintain parallel structure to enhance clarity and readability.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Lexical Resource\", \"band\": 6.5, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"team sports are the best method to teach youngsters how to cooperate\", \"cooperative learning strategies in classrooms, group projects, community service activities and even creative pursuits like theatre or music\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"strategising\", \"type\": \"spelling error\", \"fix\": \"strategizing\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Incorporate a wider range of vocabulary to express ideas more precisely and avoid repetition.\", \"Use more varied sentence structures to enhance the overall fluency and coherence of the essay.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Grammatical Range & Accuracy\", \"band\": 7.5, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"team sports can indeed foster collaboration skills\", \"students can have many opportunities to recognise the strengths as well as the shortcomings of each teammate\", \"cooperation skills can be cultivated through a range of activities beyond team sports\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"strategising\", \"type\": \"spelling error\", \"fix\": \"strategizing\"}, {\"span\": \"the youth to understand diverse perspectives\", \"type\": \"word choice\", \"fix\": \"young people to understand diverse perspectives\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Use more varied sentence structures to enhance complexity.\", \"Ensure consistent spelling conventions, especially between British and American English.\"]}], \"overall\": 7.0, \"votes\": [7.0, 7.0, 7.0], \"dispersion\": 0.0, \"confidence\": \"high\", \"meta\": {\"prompt_hash\": \"training_data\", \"model\": \"training\", \"schema_version\": \"v1\", \"rubric_version\": \"rubric/v1\", \"token_usage\": {\"input_tokens\": 355, \"output_tokens\": 500}}}"}]}

Consequently, they may lose their inspiration and it can lead to their poor performance with all that entails. I agree that this may have a fruitless effect on not only their future concert tours but in general on their future career. For instance, some popular singers in the UK have left their music industry because they do not get enough motivation and reward from their fans, who do not visit their performances.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, there are no downsides in the proliferation of downloading their music through websites. This is because they earn a chunk of income sources, which is usually made by singers, such as: concert tours, a bunch of private concerts and shows.Besides, publishing their music on YouTube provides them a tremendous effect and income,where they can earn some money on watching and downloading their songs from it. Conversely, they have a prosperous life without making ends meet. \r\n\r\nIn conclusion, I reckon that there is a negative result from illegally downloading songs via the Internet.

In my opinion, this is a matter of debate in light of different factors before any conclusion can be drawn. \r\n\r\nThere are various compelling reasons why teenagers should spend their leisure time doing unpaid work for the community. To begin with, this is a great opportunity for them to gain some practical working experience. Through these kinds of activities, they may face certain challenges which would help sharpen their soft skills and widen their horizons as well as having a multi-dimensional view when evaluating and tackling the problems. For example, in some developed countries such as America or Australia, teenagers will take part in some church activities including cleaning, decorating for special occasions and giving a hand in some team works. That would help them enhance their problem-solving skills and the ability to work with each other as a team. Another noteworthy benefit that should be taken into consideration is that when contributing to society, those juveniles will learn how to love and share with people around them leading to a healthy mind and a friendly society. \r\n\r\nOn the other hand, teenagers should enjoy their free time in the ways they want. As for most of the parts they are fully occupied with their hectic schedules at school, so it is unfair to ask them to work without pay. They have the right to hang out with their friends or play sports to blow off some steam and achieve great physical and mental development. Provided that fact that they join in the community work without payment, they will get exhausted and that might affect their daily routine, and in the worst-case scenario, that would have a negative influence on their academic performance. For instance, in some cultures, teenagers have to spend their holidays working for the pagodas or temples from 4.30 in the morning until 7.30 in the evening and they have to go to bed at 8 o’clock.

What is your opinion?\n\nScore this IELTS Task 2 essay according to the rubric, ensuring alignment with the question:\n\nThe robot is one of the people’s developments which are recently becoming a hot topic. An artificial intelligence robot can do almost every work by the data. Because of this ability, some people say that the intelligent robot will do all jobs in the future. But the others say it will not. Therefore, in this essay, I will discuss  this topic.\r\n\r\n  First, an artificial intelligence robot is more efficient than a human. AIBO mainly work with the input data, so it is more authentic than people. Also, it has a fast judgment. In other words, it judges the situation or the problem immediately by using the system. For example, there is an AIBO is calculating the mathematical problems. It solves the problem by finding out the example of the problem in several data which are input in it. Thus, some people say AIBO will do all jobs in the future.\r\n\r\n  Second, some think AI has no ability to create. AIBO’s thinking is limited by the information in their system. As a result, it cannot find a solution to a problem that it never met before. Moreover, AIBO has no feelings. It can copy people’s emotions and instincts, however, it has no ability to understand and feel it. For instance, some jobs such as writer who needs to explain the emotional exchanges between the characters are hard to explain well by a robot. Therefore, I think artificial intelligence robot does not have the ability to develop.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, artificial intelligence robot is a great invention of human. It has the advantage of being more efficient than people with accumulated thinking and expedited judgment. However, jobs like writer and scientist who has to understand the well human feeling and find out new things cannot be done by AIBO.

For this reason, people believe that the best way to reduce crime is to educate people in prison so they can get a job when leave prison. Do you agree or disagree?\n\nScore this IELTS Task 2 essay according to the rubric, ensuring alignment with the question:\n\nMany said that educating inmates in prison is the most effective method to reduce the crime levels. Although this way could be associated with some benefits, I believe that the government should implement better alternatives to tackle the problem\r\n\r\nAdmittedly, educating criminals in prisons could be beneficial for alleviating the crime rate. For one thing, education for offenders in prison provides them some fundamental knowledge to pursue higher education programs and may change their awareness. Countries such as Singapore, where to allow prisoners to study during the execution of the sentence, regularly have the lowest crime rate among the parts of the world. For another, offering a learning program in prisons for criminals could be regarded as a way of assisting them to get a job after release from prison. In fact, some prisons enable inmates to learn vocational training such as computer programming, graphic design, which may facilitate them to earn a living. This is particularly important, especially when offenders re-assimilate into society and therefore prevent recidivism effectively.\r\n\r\nHowever, there are some reasons why education could not be considered as a proper measure for offenders during their time in prison. Firstly, such a form of education is offered for those who engage in wrongful acts, and therefore this could diminish the crime level to a certain extent. Instead, equipping students with crime knowledge in school will help shape crime prevention thinking and awareness for students, which will significantly reduce crime rates in the long term. Secondly, for some criminals who could not change their minds by educating, harsh punishment or even serving longer sentences would be better. Indeed, for some white-collar crimes who have highly educated and high positions in society, such as lawyers or doctors, there is no point in educating them rather than implementing a policy of zero tolerance.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, it seems to me that although educating inmates in prison is an optimal way to reduce the crime level, it is not the best solution, as there are more feasible methods

I strongly believe that although international companies cannot be responsible for solving social problems, small businesses should be accompanied by local communities in curbing certain issues.\r\n\r\nThe first and foremost argument is that businesses have a great impact on society as well as contribute to a country's economic posterity. To extend, businesses have a significant role in preventing society from turning into a 'throw-away society' and producing waste resources. Consequently, companies should enlighten local people to be aware of certain issues such as consumerism, capitalism, etc. To cite an example, several businesses published advertisements to inform people about inflation on social media platforms in Turkey. As a result, people did not tend to buy products for the risk of the waste of money for a while. This emphasises the significance of the effects on society while having these companies.\r\n\r\nRegarding another argument, businesses also should take action when natural accidents happen. To expand the idea, while natural accidents such as earthquakes, downpours, etc, they are obliged to help with their equipment, or financially. For instance, the big earthquake, which was measured 7,4 points out of 12, happened in 2023 in Turkey. During this period, all small and international businesses volunteered to donate adequately to the minister of health, and they opened supplies such as cars, and agricultural machines for free to use.\r\n\r\nTo conclude, despite a belief that people deem businesses do not have any social responsibility in today's world, I am on the side of people who understand the gravity of actions taken by companies.\n\nProvide your assessment in the specified JSON format."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"per_criterion\": [{\"name\": \"Task Response\", \"band\": 7.0, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"I strongly believe that although international companies cannot be responsible for solving social problems, small businesses should be accompanied by local communities in curbing certain issues.\", \"businesses have a great impact on society as well as contribute to a country's economic posterity.\", \"I am on the side of people who understand the gravity of actions taken by companies.\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"while natural accidents such as earthquakes, downpours, etc, they are obliged to help\", \"type\": \"grammatical error\", \"fix\": \"remove 'they' to correct the sentence structure\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Provide more specific examples of how businesses can engage in social responsibility beyond just responding to natural disasters.\", \"Clarify the distinction between the responsibilities of small businesses versus international companies to enhance the argument.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Coherence & Cohesion\", \"band\": 6.0, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"businesses should undertake responsibilities or not\", \"businesses have a great impact on society as well as contribute to a country's economic posterity\", \"I am on the side of people who understand the gravity of actions taken by companies\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"while natural accidents such as earthquakes, downpours, etc, they are obliged to help\", \"type\": \"sentence structure\", \"fix\": \"Remove 'they' to correct the sentence: 'while natural accidents such as earthquakes, downpours, etc. occur, businesses are obliged to help.'\"}, {\"span\": \"the big earthquake, which was measured 7,4 points out of 12\", \"type\": \"numerical expression\", \"fix\": \"Use a decimal point instead of a comma: 'which was measured 7.4 points out of 12'\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Use clearer transitions between ideas to enhance the flow of the essay.\", \"Ensure numerical expressions are consistent and correctly formatted throughout the essay.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Lexical Resource\", \"band\": 6.0, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"businesses should undertake responsibilities\", \"preventing society from turning into a 'throw-away society'\", \"the gravity of actions taken by companies\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"the risk of the waste of money\", \"type\": \"word choice\", \"fix\": \"the risk of wasting money\"}, {\"span\": \"donate adequately to the minister of health\", \"type\": \"word choice\", \"fix\": \"donate appropriately to the Ministry of Health\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Use more varied vocabulary to express similar ideas, such as using synonyms or more precise terms.\", \"Avoid redundancy in phrases; for example, instead of 'the risk of the waste of money', use 'the risk of wasting money' for clarity.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Grammatical Range & Accuracy\", \"band\": 7.0, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"businesses have a significant role in preventing society from turning into a 'throw-away society' and producing waste resources.\", \"this emphasises the significance of the effects on society while having these companies.\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"while natural accidents such as earthquakes, downpours, etc, they are obliged to help\", \"type\": \"sentence structure\", \"fix\": \"while natural accidents such as earthquakes and downpours occur, they are obliged to help\"}, {\"span\": \"the big earthquake, which was measured 7,4 points out of 12\", \"type\": \"punctuation\", \"fix\": \"the big earthquake, which was measured 7.4 points out of 12\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Use more complex sentence structures to enhance grammatical range.\", \"Ensure correct punctuation, especially with decimal numbers.\"]}], \"overall\": 6.5, \"votes\": [6.5, 6.5, 6.5], \"dispersion\": 0.0, \"confidence\": \"high\", \"meta\": {\"prompt_hash\": \"training_data\", \"model\": \"training\", \"schema_version\": \"v1\", \"rubric_version\": \"rubric/v1\", \"token_usage\": {\"input_tokens\": 300, \"output_tokens\": 500}}}"}]}

In this way, they will be able to afford their own apartment or start a new family. In terms of their career, getting a job brings the opportunity to gain experience in specific fields. Indeed, spend time working in a real industry and sharing different points of views with co-workers and bosses, gives an invaluable knowledge about the process.  \nDespite the arguments mentioned above, I believe that is more beneficial for students to continue their studies. Firstly, academic qualifications are required in the majority of professions. For example, it is impossible to become a doctor, teacher or lawyer without having a degree. As a result, nowadays a large number of industries and hospitals are only hiring people who have a bachelor degree or higher. Secondly, in recent years, the job market is becoming more competitive and sometimes there are hundred of applicants for one position in a company. Subsequently, young people who do not have a degree will not be able to compete and without a job is more difficult to continue growing in a career. \nBy way of conclusion, I believe that students will be more successful in their lives if they continue their studies beyond school level.\n\nProvide your assessment in the specified JSON format."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"per_criterion\": [{\"name\": \"Task Response\", \"band\": 8.0, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"I would argue that are more benefits in going to college or university.\", \"I believe that is more beneficial for students to continue their studies.\", \"students will be more successful in their lives if they continue their studies beyond school level.\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"that are more benefits\", \"type\": \"grammatical error\", \"fix\": \"that there are more benefits\"}, {\"span\": \"it is impossible to become a doctor, teacher or lawyer without having a degree\", \"type\": \"lack of specificity\", \"fix\": \"provide examples of degrees required for each profession\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Clarify the argument by providing more specific examples of how higher education leads to better job opportunities.\", \"Improve grammatical accuracy to enhance clarity, particularly in complex sentences.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Coherence & Cohesion\", \"band\": 7.0, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"I would argue that are more benefits in going to college or university.\", \"In this way, they will be able to afford their own apartment or start a new family.\", \"I believe that students will be more successful in their lives if they continue their studies beyond school level.\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"that are more benefits in going to college or university\", \"type\": \"grammatical error\", \"fix\": \"that there are more benefits in going to college or university\"}, {\"span\": \"spend time working in a real industry\", \"type\": \"tense inconsistency\", \"fix\": \"spending time working in a real industry\"}, {\"span\": \"there are hundred of applicants\", \"type\": \"pluralization error\", \"fix\": \"there are hundreds of applicants\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Ensure subject-verb agreement and correct grammatical structures to enhance clarity.\", \"Use consistent verb tenses throughout the essay to maintain coherence.\", \"Vary sentence structures to improve the flow and connection between ideas.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Lexical Resource\", \"band\": 7.0, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"the access to have an independent lifestyle\", \"gives an invaluable knowledge about the process\", \"the job market is becoming more competitive\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"are more benefits in going to college or university\", \"type\": \"grammar\", \"fix\": \"there are more benefits to going to college or university\"}, {\"span\": \"a bachelor degree or higher\", \"type\": \"word choice\", \"fix\": \"a bachelor's degree or higher\"}, {\"span\": \"hundred of applicants\", \"type\": \"number agreement\", \"fix\": \"hundreds of applicants\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Use more varied vocabulary to express ideas, such as synonyms for 'benefits' or 'opportunity'.\", \"Ensure grammatical structures are correct, particularly with articles and prepositions.\", \"Pay attention to pluralization and collective nouns to avoid errors in number agreement.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Grammatical Range & Accuracy\", \"band\": 8.0, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"I would argue that are more benefits in going to college or university.\", \"Indeed, spend time working in a real industry and sharing different points of views with co-workers and bosses, gives an invaluable knowledge about the process.\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"that are more benefits in going to college or university.\", \"type\": \"subject-verb agreement\", \"fix\": \"that there are more benefits in going to college or university.\"}, {\"span\": \"spend time working\", \"type\": \"tense consistency\", \"fix\": \"spending time working\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Ensure subject-verb agreement is maintained throughout the essay.\", \"Use gerunds consistently to improve the flow and grammatical accuracy of sentences.\"]}], \"overall\": 7.5, \"votes\": [7.5, 7.5, 7.5], \"dispersion\": 0.0, \"confidence\": \"high\", \"meta\": {\"prompt_hash\": \"training_data\", \"model\": \"training\", \"schema_version\": \"v1\", \"rubric_version\": \"rubric/v1\", \"token_usage\": {\"input_tokens\": 313, \"output_tokens\": 500}}}"}]}

To what extent do you agree or disagree?\n\nScore this IELTS Task 2 essay according to the rubric, ensuring alignment with the question:\n\nEducation plays a vital role in improving human well-being. There has been an inconclusive debate about whether the main objective of going to school is to transform students into workers, instead of offering  advantages to them individually, which I agree with this viewpoint. In this essay, the reasons supporting my idea will be presented in detail. \r\n\r\nFirst of all, most ordinary schools do not teach children about the necessary skill for living such as cooking, growing vegetables, raising animals, and constructing a house. They teach only the subjects that are important for studying in  higher education  and working in the companies, including Math, Science, and languages. Therefore, children cannot rely on themselves in order to produce their own food  and build their own house, Consequently, they need to work in the companies to put food on the table and need to collect money to buy a house. To illustrate the good education, Jone Jundai, a founder of homeschooling in Chiangmai, teaches his sons to cultivate various plants to consume, to raise chickens to collect eggs, as well as build earth houses, which pupils can have their own residence since young ages. \r\n\r\nFurthermore, the recent educational system solely focuses on the score and GPA. As a result, the students who are not fit with this particular system, and may have the talents for other issues such as dancing, singing, and drawing, are identified as stupid persons  and find it difficult to get jobs. For example, Jack Ma, a founder of Alibaba companies, the second richest person in China, was rejected from many prestigious universities as he could not pass the exams and the interviews. However, nowadays he is one of the most successful persons in the world by establishing the pioneering online shopping website in China. Thus, universities are not beneficial for some people.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, according to the information mentioned above, I strongly agree with the statement due to lack of basic skills for survival, and the curriculums focusing on scores are not suitable for all students who are different and unique.\n\nProvide your assessment in the specified JSON format."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"per_criterion\": [{\"name\": \"Task Response\", \"band\": 9.0, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"the main objective of going to school is to transform students into workers, instead of offering advantages to them individually\", \"most ordinary schools do not teach children about the necessary skill for living such as cooking, growing vegetables, raising animals, and constructing a house\", \"the recent educational system solely focuses on the score and GPA\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"which I agree with this viewpoint\", \"type\": \"clarity\", \"fix\": \"which I agree with\"}, {\"span\": \"the necessary skill for living\", \"type\": \"grammar\", \"fix\": \"the necessary skills for living\"}, {\"span\": \"the students who are not fit with this particular system\", \"type\": \"word choice\", \"fix\": \"the students who do not fit into this particular system\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Clarify your stance by rephrasing 'which I agree with this viewpoint' to enhance clarity.\", \"Ensure subject-verb agreement by changing 'the necessary skill for living' to 'the necessary skills for living'.\", \"Use more precise language by changing 'the students who are not fit with this particular system' to 'the students who do not fit into this particular system' for better readability.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Coherence & Cohesion\", \"band\": 8.0, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"the main objective of going to school is to transform students into workers, instead of offering advantages to them individually\", \"children cannot rely on themselves in order to produce their own food and build their own house\", \"the recent educational system solely focuses on the score and GPA\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"which I agree with this viewpoint\", \"type\": \"grammatical error\", \"fix\": \"which I agree with\"}, {\"span\": \"the students who are not fit with this particular system, and may have the talents for other issues\", \"type\": \"sentence structure\", \"fix\": \"the students who do not fit into this particular system and may have talents in other areas\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Ensure that all phrases are grammatically correct to enhance clarity.\", \"Use more varied sentence structures to improve the flow of ideas.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Lexical Resource\", \"band\": 8.0, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"Education plays a vital role in improving human well-being.\", \"the students who are not fit with this particular system, and may have the talents for other issues such as dancing, singing, and drawing, are identified as stupid persons\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"the necessary skill for living\", \"type\": \"word choice\", \"fix\": \"the necessary skills for living\"}, {\"span\": \"the curriculums focusing on scores\", \"type\": \"pluralization error\", \"fix\": \"the curricula focusing on scores\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Use a wider range of synonyms to avoid repetition, especially when discussing similar concepts.\", \"Ensure subject-verb agreement and correct pluralization in noun phrases.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Grammatical Range & Accuracy\", \"band\": 9.0, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"Education plays a vital role in improving human well-being.\", \"the students who are not fit with this particular system, and may have the talents for other issues such as dancing, singing, and drawing, are identified as stupid persons\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"the necessary skill for living\", \"type\": \"subject-verb agreement\", \"fix\": \"the necessary skills for living\"}, {\"span\": \"the curriculums focusing on scores are not suitable for all students who are different and unique\", \"type\": \"plural noun usage\", \"fix\": \"the curricula focusing on scores are not suitable for all students who are different and unique\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Use more varied sentence structures to enhance the complexity of the writing.\", \"Ensure subject-verb agreement and pluralization are consistently applied throughout the essay.\"]}], \"overall\": 8.5, \"votes\": [8.5, 8.5, 8.5], \"dispersion\": 0.0, \"confidence\": \"high\", \"meta\": {\"prompt_hash\": \"training_data\", \"model\": \"training\", \"schema_version\": \"v1\", \"rubric_version\": \"rubric/v1\", \"token_usage\": {\"input_tokens\": 375, \"output_tokens\": 500}}}"}]}

To what extent do you agree or disagree?\n\nScore this IELTS Task 2 essay according to the rubric, ensuring alignment with the question:\n\nIn today’s society, people have various viewpoints on whether news has no correlation to people’s lives.

In reality, there are yellow journalists who rely on profits instead of giving citizens access to meaningful stories. For instance, Vietnamese reporters usually make the hottest headlines about the death of some renowned celebrities namely Phuong My Chi, which leads to a focus of publicity and controversy. Therefore, viewers can be misunderstanding about the publicity that they are following and waste their time in the process.\r\n\r\nHowere, I also think that people should spend time speculating  on the newspapers and watching television news programs. Firstly, news is appearing increasingly eye-catching and with informative content, rather than sensational news in the past.It is undeniable that news is the information and reports about the event that occurred in recent times, and they are categorized into various fields , so watching news means pondering specific fields of business. For example, while businesses can watch news to know what is happening with the economy, people who like sports can watch news about competitions in sports fields to relax. Moreover, during the Covid 19-pandemic, watching news can help people know more information about vaccine, diseases as soon as possible to protect their health.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, while I agree that news has no correlation to people’s lives, I also believe that people should spend their time reading the newspaper and watching television news programs to gain more knowledge from this.

Nonetheless, I personally lean more toward the latter view, simply because the level of benefits is heavily affected by the individual point of view or circumstance.\r\n\r\nThere are several cases that unpaid service would be beneficial experience for high school children. For instance, they would be able to develop a sense of community or meet new people regardless of their individual skill or aptitude. According to a research paper issued by Cambridge University last year, the majority of successful people in business intentionally participate some volunteer activity at an early age in order to create connections for the future. Considering that childhood is a preparation period for a member of society, it is no doubt providing them such opportunities are more practical and fruitful idea.\r\n\r\nTurning to the other side of the argument, it could be acknowledged as a just hindrance for achieving an individual goal. Firstly, for the people who are considering to go to the university as their future plan, their top priority may not make  connections but building up academic knowledge or conquering examination.

To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?\n\nScore this IELTS Task 2 essay according to the rubric, ensuring alignment with the question:\n\nIn recent times, several people have had conflicts about whether employers have to obey the dress principles in office or whether the productivity of work is their priority. I strongly believe that people should concentrate on the quality of their work completely instead of their dress, and this essay serves to elaborate on my opinion.\r\n\r\nA majority of people argue that employers prioritize the quality of their work. When people pay all their attention to working, their production and performance in a company will be better and bring several benefits for both themselves and this company instead of spending time on resolving the problem related to fashion. Specifically, their company receives more reputation, hence employment's career and position may have a chance to be promoted. For instance,in a prestigious company like Apple, there are no requirements about the employees' dress, Apple's employees spend most time on design, fixing errors, and enhancing their products. These criteria made Apple become a famous and successful brand and community with several electronic devices existing everywhere.\r\n\r\nMoreover, the dress restrictions may expand the gap between employment in their working environment. Several companies force their workers to wear impolite clothes with many costume accessories, some staff want to show their wealth to others by their fashion style and only interact with people who have brand clothes like them and avoid working with people wearing simple clothes. Hence, after a long time, these kinds of working environments may become a fashion competition, instead, people have to create ideas, and products to promote and increase the company's profit. Many companies have collapsed for a similar reason that the directors create complicated and unnecessary principles that lead to low-quality working environment, so many employees quit their jobs and these companies lose their customers.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, I firmly believe that bosses should not impose dress rules on their staff based on the effect on the productivity and workplace.\n\nProvide your assessment in the specified JSON format."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"per_criterion\": [{\"name\": \"Task Response\", \"band\": 6.0, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"I strongly believe that people should concentrate on the quality of their work completely instead of their dress\", \"the productivity and workplace\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"the dress principles in office\", \"type\": \"clarity\", \"fix\": \"the dress code in the office\"}, {\"span\": \"the directors create complicated and unnecessary principles\", \"type\": \"clarity\", \"fix\": \"the directors create complicated and unnecessary dress codes\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Provide more specific examples to support your arguments, such as data or studies related to productivity and dress codes.\", \"Clarify your points by using more precise language, especially when discussing dress codes and their impact on work.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Coherence & Cohesion\", \"band\": 5.0, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"I strongly believe that people should concentrate on the quality of their work completely instead of their dress\", \"these kinds of working environments may become a fashion competition\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"the dress restrictions may expand the gap between employment in their working environment\", \"type\": \"word choice\", \"fix\": \"replace 'employment' with 'employees'\"}, {\"span\": \"hence employment's career and position may have a chance to be promoted\", \"type\": \"grammatical error\", \"fix\": \"rephrase to 'hence employees' careers and positions may have a chance to be promoted'\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Use clearer topic sentences at the beginning of each paragraph to guide the reader on what to expect.\", \"Ensure that pronouns and references are clear to avoid confusion, such as specifying 'employees' instead of 'employment'.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Lexical Resource\", \"band\": 5.0, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"the productivity of work is their priority\", \"the dress restrictions may expand the gap between employment in their working environment\", \"these kinds of working environments may become a fashion competition\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"employment's career and position may have a chance to be promoted\", \"type\": \"word choice\", \"fix\": \"employees' careers and positions may have a chance to be promoted\"}, {\"span\": \"the directors create complicated and unnecessary principles that lead to low-quality working environment\", \"type\": \"plurality error\", \"fix\": \"the directors create complicated and unnecessary principles that lead to a low-quality working environment\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Use more varied vocabulary to express ideas, such as synonyms for 'work' and 'dress'.\", \"Pay attention to subject-verb agreement and plurality to enhance grammatical accuracy.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Grammatical Range & Accuracy\", \"band\": 6.0, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"I strongly believe that people should concentrate on the quality of their work completely instead of their dress\", \"the dress restrictions may expand the gap between employment in their working environment\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"employment's career and position may have a chance to be promoted\", \"type\": \"subject-verb agreement\", \"fix\": \"employees' careers and positions may have a chance to be promoted\"}, {\"span\": \"the directors create complicated and unnecessary principles that lead to low-quality working environment\", \"type\": \"article usage\", \"fix\": \"the directors create complicated and unnecessary principles that lead to a low-quality working environment\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Vary sentence structures to include more complex sentences and clauses.\", \"Ensure correct use of possessive forms and plural nouns to improve clarity.\"]}], \"overall\": 5.5, \"votes\": [5.5, 5.5, 5.5], \"dispersion\": 0.0, \"confidence\": \"high\", \"meta\": {\"prompt_hash\": \"training_data\", \"model\": \"training\", \"schema_version\": \"v1\", \"rubric_version\": \"rubric/v1\", \"token_usage\": {\"input_tokens\": 352, \"output_tokens\": 500}}}"}]}

I disagree with this idea for two main reasons. First, increasing energy prices will not have a significant impact on the amount and patterns of fuel consumption. The second reason is that hiking energy prices will create more economic problems. \r\n\r\nThe first reason why I am against raising the cost of fuel is that it can not have a remarkable effect on fuel consumption. People cannot change the amount of fuel they usually consume since their lifestyle and daily needs cannot be easily changed. They have to go to the same places for work and other purposes every day. Therefore, the amount of fuel they demand for these needs will not considerably decline after rising prices. For example, a survey conducted in the United Arab Emirates has demonstrated that rising the price of fuel could alter individuals' consumption patterns in only 15% of the participants investigated. \r\n\r\nMoreover, making energy more expensive would pose more economic problems. The first area affected by hiking fuel prices is transportation, which plays a salient role in the economy. This will increase the price of other products and services, exerting a detrimental impact on people's lives. It goes without saying that this strategy will not have any meaningful contribution to solving environmental problems.

It is often argued that artificial intelligence play a crucial role in future, whilst others disagree and think that this can have adverse ramifications on people. Although many people claim that the use of robots might have negative repercussions, I firmly believe AI can improve people's life. This essay will not only shed light on both perceptions but also my point of view will be elaborated in the conclusion.\r\n\r\nInitiating with the points supporting the first school of thought. To begin with, scientists believe that robots can replace employees which will not only  save time but also money. This is because in this period of cutting-edge technology artificial intelligence are more ideal than human. In other words, this may cause a decline in financial damages as well as robots get more work done in less time. As an illustration, a recent study held at Standford University found that artificial intelligence such as virtual travel booking agents can help people more than humans can find the best and cheap tickets more quickly than humans.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, a multitude of people argues that robots can cause a couple of problems too. Firstly, machines are extremely costly and require a high initial investment which may impact a business. Secondly, people will become more dependent on robots in their daily life and this may harmfully affect their skills like cooking and driving. So people become less active and this may result in some health problems like obesity. For instance, The New York Times reported in March 2016 that UAE has automatic cars such as Tesla so people would not need to drive to work. As a result, 60% of the citizen in Dubai does not know how to drive a car.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, according to my perspective, artificial intelligence has proven to be more advantageous for the public.

Many people claim that people have more responsibility to fight climate change, while others reject this notion. In my opinion, we should work more to fight against climate change to be more rational. \r\n\r\nThere are myriad reasons that will further explain this argument. Still, the most predominant one stems from the fact that the environment has significant influences on our wellbeing, and hurting the earth means hurting ourselves. The Covid-19 pandemic has vividly demonstrated this. The virus can spread due to our poaching of wild primates' nature. As a result, many countries took damaging blows to their economies and the life of their citizens. Furthermore, many prominent business chains do not have to spend significant money on carbon emissions. In that situation, if citizens do not raise their voices against pollution, the government does not follow the legislation to protect the environment.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, some others believe that global warming is most appealing for economic practices. Poor communities are unable to afford environment-friendly methods of production. For example, from 2020, The tech- giant company Apple did not provide charging adapters with iPhones upon purchase. Because they have avoided mining a significant amount of materials from the earth and conserved copper, zinc, and many metals used for manufacturing a charging adapter, this decision by the technology giant had caused a furore among buyers. Another pivotal aspect of this argument is that people use lots of fossil fuels for their everyday work, detrimental to the environment.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, according to the arguments mentioned above, I feel that to save our planet and secure our next generation, scientists, policymakers, social workers, and the government should take several steps to overcome the situation and make the world a better place.\n\nProvide your assessment in the specified JSON format."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"per_criterion\": [{\"name\": \"Task Response\", \"band\": 9.0, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"we should work more to fight against climate change to be more rational.\", \"hurting the earth means hurting ourselves.\", \"scientists, policymakers, social workers, and the government should take several steps to overcome the situation and make the world a better place.\"], \"errors\": [], \"suggestions\": [\"Provide more specific examples or data to support claims about the impact of climate change.\", \"Address counterarguments more thoroughly to strengthen the overall argument.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Coherence & Cohesion\", \"band\": 8.5, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"the environment has significant influences on our wellbeing, and hurting the earth means hurting ourselves.\", \"the government does not follow the legislation to protect the environment.\", \"to save our planet and secure our next generation, scientists, policymakers, social workers, and the government should take several steps to overcome the situation\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"the virus can spread due to our poaching of wild primates' nature.\", \"type\": \"clarity issue\", \"fix\": \"Rephrase to clarify the connection between poaching and virus spread, e.g., 'the virus can spread due to the destruction of wildlife habitats caused by poaching.'\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Use clearer transitions between ideas to enhance the flow of the essay.\", \"Ensure that all claims are supported with clear examples or evidence to strengthen the argument.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Lexical Resource\", \"band\": 8.5, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"the environment has significant influences on our wellbeing\", \"the virus can spread due to our poaching of wild primates' nature\", \"this decision by the technology giant had caused a furore among buyers\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"the most predominant one stems from the fact that\", \"type\": \"word choice\", \"fix\": \"the most significant reason stems from the fact that\"}, {\"span\": \"the government does not follow the legislation to protect the environment\", \"type\": \"collocation\", \"fix\": \"the government does not enforce legislation to protect the environment\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Use a wider range of synonyms to avoid repetition, such as replacing 'significant' with 'crucial' or 'vital'.\", \"Incorporate more advanced vocabulary related to environmental issues to enhance the essay's sophistication.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Grammatical Range & Accuracy\", \"band\": 9.0, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"the environment has significant influences on our wellbeing\", \"the government does not follow the legislation to protect the environment\", \"scientists, policymakers, social workers, and the government should take several steps\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"the virus can spread due to our poaching of wild primates' nature\", \"type\": \"word choice\", \"fix\": \"the virus can spread due to our poaching of wild primates\"}, {\"span\": \"the life of their citizens\", \"type\": \"awkward phrasing\", \"fix\": \"the lives of their citizens\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Use more varied sentence structures to enhance complexity.\", \"Ensure subject-verb agreement is maintained throughout the essay.\"]}], \"overall\": 9.0, \"votes\": [9.0, 9.0, 9.0], \"dispersion\": 0.0, \"confidence\": \"high\", \"meta\": {\"prompt_hash\": \"training_data\", \"model\": \"training\", \"schema_version\": \"v1\", \"rubric_version\": \"rubric/v1\", \"token_usage\": {\"input_tokens\": 337, \"output_tokens\": 500}}}"}]}

In particular, old model private cars release three times more sulphate than the contempory one. Since the collapse of the oil price, private car sales have been triple.

It is highly probable that this policy would decrease the number of cars on roads, thus improve the air quality and reduce carbon emittion.\r\n\r\nMoreover, increasing the cost of transportation with fossil fuel would create an incentive for cooperation to switch to other more environmental friendly alternatives, such as electric trucks and rails. These means of transportation consume electricity instead of burning fuels which produce pollutant during the process. Although most of the electricity productions nowadays still depend on buring fossil fuel, they produce a lot less green house gasses compared to vehicals.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, we should expect that the increase of fuel price would lead to cities with less fuel buring vehical and a shift towards eletric vehical.

Most individuals tend to find out the history of the place they live in due to various reasons. In this essay, I will elaborate on why they think that way and how they can find out the history associated with it.\r\n\r\nFirst of all, in some cases, when someone starts living in the house, they listen to strange sounds and feel unsafe. They observe that there might be any crime or killing-related event that could have happened. For instance, in movies, we have often seen that the house is haunted due to an unusual activity committed by previous owners. As a result, they will be well aware of any unexpected bad luck coming their way. In addition, they might want to find out if there is any repair or upgradation needed. If the building was built a long time ago with not good materials, replacement and maintenance would be important. An illustration of  this is that many authorities public a restricted law limiting the usable time of a building to about 50 years. After that, the building has to be either demolished or reconstructed.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the handiest way of finding the history of the building is to reach out to a lawyer. Since lawyers have certain contacts and access to some information which ordinary people do not have, they can easily find out if there was any case related to the place. For example, in some cases, people might hide information that can cause roadblocks in selling their house, but by doing a background check via lawyers, everything will be transparent. This way, the current owner will have the knowledge needed and will be satisfied with their present home.\r\n\r\nTo put it in a nutshell, it is common these days that folks want to know everything related to their apartment and there is no harm in doing so by reaching out to government officials and ordinary people.\n\nProvide your assessment in the specified JSON format."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"per_criterion\": [{\"name\": \"Task Response\", \"band\": 8.0, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"I will elaborate on why they think that way and how they can find out the history associated with it.\", \"the handiest way of finding the history of the building is to reach out to a lawyer.\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"there might be any crime or killing-related event that could have happened\", \"type\": \"clarity\", \"fix\": \"there might have been a crime or killing-related event that occurred\"}, {\"span\": \"many authorities public a restricted law limiting the usable time of a building\", \"type\": \"word choice\", \"fix\": \"many authorities publish a regulation limiting the usable lifespan of a building\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Provide more specific examples or case studies to strengthen the argument about why people are concerned about the history of their homes.\", \"Clarify the conclusion by summarizing the key points discussed in the essay to reinforce the main argument.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Coherence & Cohesion\", \"band\": 7.0, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"In this essay, I will elaborate on why they think that way and how they can find out the history associated with it.\", \"To put it in a nutshell, it is common these days that folks want to know everything related to their apartment and there is no harm in doing so by reaching out to government officials and ordinary people.\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"they listen to strange sounds and feel unsafe.\", \"type\": \"clarity\", \"fix\": \"Clarify who 'they' refers to in this context.\"}, {\"span\": \"many authorities public a restricted law limiting the usable time of a building to about 50 years.\", \"type\": \"word choice\", \"fix\": \"Replace 'public' with 'publish' for correct usage.\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Ensure that pronouns like 'they' are clearly defined to avoid ambiguity.\", \"Use more precise vocabulary to enhance clarity, such as replacing 'public' with 'publish' in the context of laws.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Lexical Resource\", \"band\": 7.0, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"they listen to strange sounds and feel unsafe\", \"they might want to find out if there is any repair or upgradation needed\", \"everything will be transparent\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"not good materials\", \"type\": \"informal language\", \"fix\": \"poor quality materials\"}, {\"span\": \"the handiest way of finding the history\", \"type\": \"informal language\", \"fix\": \"the most convenient way of discovering the history\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Use more formal vocabulary to enhance the academic tone of the essay.\", \"Incorporate a wider range of synonyms to avoid repetition and demonstrate greater lexical variety.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Grammatical Range & Accuracy\", \"band\": 8.0, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"they listen to strange sounds and feel unsafe.\", \"they can easily find out if there was any case related to the place.\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"many authorities public a restricted law\", \"type\": \"word choice\", \"fix\": \"many authorities publish a restricted law\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Consider varying sentence structures more by using complex sentences to enhance the grammatical range.\", \"Ensure the correct use of verbs, especially in terms of word choice, to improve accuracy.\"]}], \"overall\": 7.5, \"votes\": [7.5, 7.5, 7.5], \"dispersion\": 0.0, \"confidence\": \"high\", \"meta\": {\"prompt_hash\": \"training_data\", \"model\": \"training\", \"schema_version\": \"v1\", \"rubric_version\": \"rubric/v1\", \"token_usage\": {\"input_tokens\": 367, \"output_tokens\": 500}}}"}]}

People are using too many non-renewable resources, including fuel for cars and vehicles, which is harmful. So, it is believed that one of the most proper ways to discharge the problems is to increase the cost of these kinds of materials, intend to make the world better. From my point of view, it is accurate to admit that this idea is absolutely unreasonable. To clear, it should be summed up in an essay\r\n\r\nAs we can see, the development of the world’s society has  contributed to energy over a long period up to now. Important inventions have been used regularly since its establishment. One of them, we mention here is  transportation, and it is related closely to the existence of resources used, like fuel. The supporting sentence at the opening said the fact about energy that may be depleted easily,might be considered  fuel. Providing that we have a look as the experts,  running out of fuel can create an economic crisis that affects badly  the number of fields to improve the countries and the citizens’ living standards. Looking at further ways , the war between Russia and Ukraine is a clear example, of when  Europe needed the advantages of fuel.\r\n\r\nThis kind of power in price rising can reduce  vehicle production which is playing a strong role to connect and upgrade other workouts. To be honest, we put ourselves in issues in order to know what is the benefit of consuming resources, mainly about petrol.\r\n\r\nHowever, in another opinion, we have a great impact to be aware of fuel price, which means we should take the cost in a suitable value. People’s efforts in replacing the consumption of normal travelling equipment with bicycles or environmentally friendly ones need to be concentrated on. With this solution,  pollution can be dealt with. On the other hand, the request from  daily living has changed people’s minds about using fewer cars or motorbikes, except in several special situations. The truth is, we had better change to comfort the world, to understand what is the real value of using energy, since the outstanding transformation of technology.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, what we have nowadays is a variety of resources to decide our future, also the responsibility for the potential dangers when they immediately come across.

While some people assert that the primary aim of this should be transforming students to responsible citizens and dedicated workers instead of focusing individual's talent and behaviour, I completely disagree with this notion. \n\nTo begin with, there are a number of reasons to support my view that concentrating on unique talents and characters of different students is quintessential. First and foremost is that monitoring and understanding the individuality of every child help to discover their personality, which, in turn, transform them into responsible citizens. This is because each child is blessed with a varied behaviour some can be short-tempered and some patient, some conserved and some friendly, therefore, it is necessary to look after every trait and educate them accordingly in order to make them capable to deal with the society. For instance, in the USA, students in Kindergarten are assigned with teachers according to their behavioural aspect in order to understand them completely and to help them to become a mature person.\n\nSecondly, my opinion is further bolstered by the factor that a focus on an individual's skill and talent is essential to provide them with a bright career. The reason for this is opting a profession of one's own interest usually lead to success and satisfaction as complete dedication and passion are generally involved in this. For example, with reference to the statistics of 'The Time', 70% of the successful people in the world are the ones who followed their innate talents. In contrast, if the purpose of teaching will only involve turning students to qualified doctors, engineers and bankers, then their inner skills will gradually vanish.\n\nIn conclusion, although

Do you agree or disagree? Why?\n\nScore this IELTS Task 2 essay according to the rubric, ensuring alignment with the question:\n\nIn the present, huge public green areas are currently replaced by several buildings in the cities, since people do not give  importance to those spaces. Nevertheless, some people believe that having public locations do not create as many benefits for people and society as having buildings for business activities. From my point of view, public spaces should be built because of numerous reasons.\r\n\r\nFirst of all, creating squares improves the mental and physical health of people. For the mental side, it assists people to alleviate stress, since they can have more time to make a long conversation about their problems and lives with their peers and families. Moreover, it strengthens relationships among families and friends, and make individuals relax and enjoy their life as they spend time on activities such as picnics and playing sports. Furthermore, they have a chance to meet strangers to share perspectives and experiences, helping them to have inspirations or new ideas. In terms of physical strength, establishing squares or green places encourage people to play sport or exercise. For instance, people can create sports clubs such as yoga and gather at the park.\r\n\r\nSecondly, governments can use squares or parks to support careers in special fields and local populations to generate income. To clarify, the ministry can launch a campaign to promote art or music by allowing a group of artists to establish exhibitions or clubs to attract interested crowds and gain revenue. In addition, the governments can encourage locals by creating markets, events and concerts, so local people will have opportunities to sell local products and tickets, and can also attract tourists to travel towns to gain more income. \r\n\r\nIn conclusion, creating public areas provides numerous advantages to an individual and families as it helps people to relieve mental well-being, and enhance physical fitness.

Some assert that the family is the primary influence, while others argue that friends, music, and movies play more significant roles. In this essay, I will explore both perspectives, discussing how families shape children and considering the impact of external influences.\r\n\r\nOn one hand, families play a crucial role in the growth of their kids as primary caregivers and mentors. For instance, parents who actively encourage a child's curiosity and nurture critical thinking significantly contribute to their intellectual growth. Additionally, when parents model positive behaviours like kindness and cooperation, these actions help them understand and adopt essential societal norms. These early lessons not only impact their current behaviour but also establish a foundation for future decision-making. In essence, the family serves as a cornerstone in fostering not just the child's immediate well-being but also their long-term growth.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, external factors like movies, music, and friends wield considerable influence over a youngster's thoughts and behaviours. The lyrics of songs and the content of films, encountered by nearly all youngsters, shape their perspectives and understanding of the world. For example, exposure to melody with positive messages or films that promote empathy can contribute to their emotional development. Furthermore, the influence of friends should not be underestimated. Friendships often involve shared experiences and fun, significantly contributing to their mindset. Children engaging in dynamic and friendly environments may develop essential qualities like open-mindedness, adaptability, and teamwork, which are valuable beyond the confines of the family setting. In this way, external influences, including media and peer interactions, play a vital part in shaping their worldview and social skills.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, while many children are initially shaped by their families, others are influenced by their surroundings.

To what extent do you agree or disagree?\n\nScore this IELTS Task 2 essay according to the rubric, ensuring alignment with the question:\n\nIn this modern world, it is argued by some politicians and authorities that climate change has been occurring for many years that is the reason why the governments should provide a solution to live in a way rather than some precautions. I partially agree with that statement and I believe that while people adapt to living with climate change and global warming, countries have to show their effort as much as possible to decrease the increasing trend of temperature.\nFirst of all, since the beginning of the Industrial Revolution, hazardous gases and wastewaters have been released by factories to nature. Moreover, it firstly has been caused global warming, then climate change. This harmful situation affected not only human beings but also all the species around the world. To save wildlife and diversity of species, governments should publish a law to ensure the nature will be protected. For instance, if biodiversity changes, all the food production and people’s nutritional behaviour will change too. Furthermore, oceans and inner sea's temperature have increased by years. For instance, while a person who lives in Greenland was not able to swim in the 1970s due to icebergs, now Greenland has become a tourist destination with its beaches. How do not people protest climate changes after witnessing that undesirable situation?\nOn the other hand, whereas governments and individuals have been showing their effort to save the environment, it is clearly seen that the average temperature of the world has been increasing constantly. Additionally, almost all countries spend a huge amount of money every year in order to protect nature. In contrast, if they invest in the health care system, infrastructures of big cities and most importantly, innovation of agriculture, it would be more beneficial not only for governments financially but also for citizens. Furthermore, as per an academic article published by the World Bank says that whereas the total budget of the countries which fight to prevent climate changes is 450 Billion USD, the effect of the human factor is only 5% to prevent increasing heat.\nIn conclusion, in the light of information given above, climate change is an undeniable fact. Every human being will face this critical issue.

Besides various compliments that people get from those sites, they also receive a lot of negative judgements about their bodies, lifestyles and behaviors that make them sad or even depressed.

Secondly, technology contributes to our learning process and it is also one of the top reasons why people are getting more and more intelligent. Today, just by sitting in front of a computer’s screen, we can easily access worldwide knowledge on the Internet, and becoming a master in our favorite areas has never been so easy. \r\n\r\nIn conclusion, in spite of the fact that technology triggers detrimental effects in our lives sometimes, I strongly believe that a life without it will be such a disaster.\n\nProvide your assessment in the specified JSON format."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"per_criterion\": [{\"name\": \"Coherence & Cohesion\", \"band\": 6.5, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"we are living in a world which lacks connection between people\", \"technology makes our lives more convenient, it saves us a huge amount of time\", \"in spite of the fact that technology triggers detrimental effects in our lives sometimes\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"technology makes our lives more convenient, it saves us a huge amount of time\", \"type\": \"run-on sentence\", \"fix\": \"Consider breaking this into two sentences: 'Technology makes our lives more convenient.

Some individuals argue that it is better to live with this phenomenon instead of  finding some ways to address these problems. Base on plenty of reasons, such as having devastating effects on peoples' lives, I totally disagree with this issue. \n\nFirstly, global warming can contribute to lots of devastating phenomena like floods and landslides. These types of events put people at risk. There is a multitude of people who are exposed to these kinds of hazards and they might lose their lives every year. For instance, there was a huge tsunami in Japan which had become the main reason for losing Japanese lives. Therefore, humankind is facing catastrophic events due to climate change, however, this alteration is gradual. Thus, scientists have to spot some ways to solve the problems. \n\nSecondly, this hazard has another implication, the extinction of animals can be rooted in this event's results. When one special kind of animal dies out, it has never been brought back. It is happening steadily, but the results are harmful. For example, Asian Lions have been wiped out because of the earth weather change due to Carbon dioxide emission. Base on these facts, governments should invest a large amount of money for addressing this obstacle. \n\nOn the other hand, our planet has faced  many different cycles of warming and cooling. So someone thinks that global warming is one of this cycle and we would accept it. Due to  loads of results from academic researches, it became clear that Mammoths were extinct because the weather had become warmer. Generally, this view might be correct, but the severity of that event is not like the problems that we have to manage these days. \n\nIn conclusion, climate change can be the main reason for many catastrophes which are not manageable, due to these facts, I totally disagree with this issue.\n\nProvide your assessment in the specified JSON format."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"per_criterion\": [{\"name\": \"Task Response\", \"band\": 8.5, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"I totally disagree with this issue.\", \"governments should invest a large amount of money for addressing this obstacle.\", \"climate change can be the main reason for many catastrophes which are not manageable.\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"Base on plenty of reasons\", \"type\": \"grammar\", \"fix\": \"Based on plenty of reasons\"}, {\"span\": \"Base on these facts\", \"type\": \"grammar\", \"fix\": \"Based on these facts\"}, {\"span\": \"the extinction of animals can be rooted in this event's results\", \"type\": \"clarity\", \"fix\": \"the extinction of animals can be a result of this event\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Ensure correct use of 'based on' instead of 'base on' throughout the essay.\", \"Clarify statements regarding the extinction of animals to improve precision and understanding.\", \"Strengthen the conclusion by summarizing the key arguments more clearly to reinforce the disagreement with the opposing view.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Coherence & Cohesion\", \"band\": 7.5, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"global warming can contribute to lots of devastating phenomena like floods and landslides\", \"governments should invest a large amount of money for addressing this obstacle\", \"climate change can be the main reason for many catastrophes which are not manageable\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"Base on plenty of reasons\", \"type\": \"grammatical error\", \"fix\": \"Based on plenty of reasons\"}, {\"span\": \"this event's results\", \"type\": \"clarity issue\", \"fix\": \"the results of this event\"}, {\"span\": \"So someone thinks that global warming is one of this cycle\", \"type\": \"cohesion issue\", \"fix\": \"Some people think that global warming is one of these cycles\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Use transitional phrases to improve the flow between ideas, such as 'Furthermore' or 'In addition'.\", \"Ensure subject-verb agreement and correct usage of prepositions to enhance clarity and grammatical accuracy.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Lexical Resource\", \"band\": 7.5, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"global warming has become one of the most conspicuous topics in the twenty-first century\", \"humankind is facing catastrophic events due to climate change\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"Base on plenty of reasons\", \"type\": \"word choice\", \"fix\": \"Based on plenty of reasons\"}, {\"span\": \"Base on these facts\", \"type\": \"word choice\", \"fix\": \"Based on these facts\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Use more varied vocabulary to express ideas, such as synonyms for 'devastating' or 'hazard'.\", \"Ensure grammatical accuracy in phrases, particularly with prepositions like 'based on' instead of 'base on'.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Grammatical Range & Accuracy\", \"band\": 8.5, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"global warming has become one of the most conspicuous topics in the twenty-first century.\", \"there is a multitude of people who are exposed to these kinds of hazards and they might lose their lives every year.\", \"climate change can be the main reason for many catastrophes which are not manageable.\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"Base on plenty of reasons\", \"type\": \"word choice\", \"fix\": \"Based on plenty of reasons\"}, {\"span\": \"Base on these facts\", \"type\": \"word choice\", \"fix\": \"Based on these facts\"}, {\"span\": \"this hazard has another implication, the extinction of animals can be rooted in this event's results.\", \"type\": \"punctuation\", \"fix\": \"this hazard has another implication: the extinction of animals can be rooted in this event's results.\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Ensure consistent use of 'based' instead of 'base' to improve accuracy.\", \"Use colons or semicolons appropriately to clarify complex sentences.\", \"Vary sentence structures to enhance the overall grammatical range.\"]}], \"overall\": 8.0, \"votes\": [8.0, 8.0, 8.0], \"dispersion\": 0.0, \"confidence\": \"high\", \"meta\": {\"prompt_hash\": \"training_data\", \"model\": \"training\", \"schema_version\": \"v1\", \"rubric_version\": \"rubric/v1\", \"token_usage\": {\"input_tokens\": 363, \"output_tokens\": 500}}}"}]}

can they ensure their overall well-being which plays an important role in their concentration. therefore, the performance of children at schools is likely to improve greatly with enthusiasm to

I totally agree with this statement and will illustrate my explanation on this topic.\n\nFirstly, the old folk are facing many problems because of improper learning. Moreover, the major challenge is unemployment. Besides, the illiteracy rate is skyrocketed in the past few years. However, the government is trying to control these numbers but, without solving the major root cause it can not be better. Furthermore, the illiterate person is always dependent on educated ones to fill out the forms or do translations.

Hence, it caused low academic achievements.\n\nSome people believe that the administration should provide this community with more resources and guidance so, they can get a basic education.

To what extent do you agree or disagree?\n\nScore this IELTS Task 2 essay according to the rubric, ensuring alignment with the question:\n\nIt is not uncommon across the world that people flood into a metropolis seeking for better working opportunities. One inescapable consequence of such massive migration is the housing shortage, which again brought about a series of chain effect: soaring house prices, unbearable burden on the working class, to name but a few. Therefore, governments are burdened with the task to provide an effective and proper solution. However, individuals as well as corporations all have a role to play.\n\nCertainly, government, with all the resources at its disposal, plays an essential part in tackling the problem. This is decided by the essence of executive. In the primitive age, there was no such thing as administration. As activities of human beings became more complex, a middle is needed to coordinate and manage the tribe. So the  rule is such a body empowered by its people to organize and take responsibility for the social affairs.  However, that is not to say that government should fight alone in the battle against the “house shortage”. After all, the citizens themselves are the direct victims and beneficiaries in this battle. Actually, there is much can be done by us to alleviate the house pressure.  As a matter of fact, as more and more people crowed in big cities, the job market there has already saturated.\n. Another  plausible approach is to build infrastructures like market or retail stores  in small cities where land charge is inexpensive. In that way, companies can save a sum of money buying the land, and more job vacancies are created in small cities, thus attracting more job hunters.\n\nTo conclude, it is the government’s essential role to solve the social problem since government can pool resources of all sorts. But, bearing in mind that we are living in a “one for all, all for one” society. If each one makes a small sacrifice, the problem will be solved soon.

Despite of having limited areas to live, many people are moving in the cities from rural areas which are causing excessive pressure on the road. However, because of the financial development of the city-dwellers, many of them are able to buy their own vehicles instead of using public transports. Since the number of private transport is increasing greatly, roads are becoming more congested to hold on to the large amount of vehicles. According to the latest report from BBC, almost 50 new vehicles are entering on the street of Dhaka, which is the main reason for the unthinkable traffic congestion of the city. According to that report, growing financial flow and excessive population are the main reasons for such amount of traffic.    \n\nDecentralizing the cities and implementing traffic laws will reduce the traffic volume efficiently. Since most of the modern facilities are available in urban life, decentralization will make sure of availability of those facilities in rural areas as well, which will demotivate rural people to migrate to the city areas. In addition, strict monitoring on traffic system will also ensure free flow of the traffic which is essential to reduce the traffic volume. Dhaka Metropolitan Police have imposed high penalty for breaking traffic laws in Gulshan and Banani recently, and the traffic condition of these areas have improved dramatically. \n\nTo conclude, it is quite certain that high traffic volume is causing due to the increased population and improved overall economy, while maintaining traffic regulation properly as well decentralizing the cities will help to improve the whole scenario.\n\nProvide your assessment in the specified JSON format."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"per_criterion\": [{\"name\": \"Task Response\", \"band\": 5.5, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"Heavy traffic congestion is causing troubles in different cities and sub-urban areas all around the world.\", \"Decentralizing the cities and implementing traffic laws will reduce the traffic volume efficiently.\", \"it is quite certain that high traffic volume is causing due to the increased population and improved overall economy\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"Despite of having limited areas to live\", \"type\": \"phrase error\", \"fix\": \"Replace 'Despite of' with 'Despite having'\"}, {\"span\": \"which can be controlled by decentralizing the cities as well as implementing appropriate traffic rules.\", \"type\": \"clarity issue\", \"fix\": \"Clarify how decentralization and traffic rules specifically address traffic congestion.\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Provide more specific examples or data to support claims about traffic congestion solutions.\", \"Clarify the connection between decentralization and traffic reduction to strengthen the argument.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Coherence & Cohesion\", \"band\": 4.5, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"heavy traffic congestion is causing troubles in different cities and sub-urban areas all around the world.\", \"Decentralizing the cities and implementing traffic laws will reduce the traffic volume efficiently.\", \"it is quite certain that high traffic volume is causing due to the increased population and improved overall economy\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"Despite of having limited areas to live\", \"type\": \"preposition error\", \"fix\": \"Change 'Despite of' to 'Despite' or 'In spite of'\"}, {\"span\": \"which will demotivate rural people to migrate to the city areas.\", \"type\": \"word choice error\", \"fix\": \"Change 'demotivate' to 'discourage'\"}, {\"span\": \"while maintaining traffic regulation properly as well decentralizing the cities\", \"type\": \"conjunction error\", \"fix\": \"Change 'as well' to 'as well as'\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Use clearer transitions between ideas to enhance flow.\", \"Avoid redundancy by rephrasing sentences that repeat similar ideas.\", \"Ensure proper use of conjunctions and prepositions for grammatical accuracy.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Lexical Resource\", \"band\": 4.5, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"Heavy traffic congestion is causing troubles in different cities and sub-urban areas all around the world.\", \"high traffic volume is increasing immensely since most of them are looking for a better living.\", \"Decentralizing the cities and implementing traffic laws will reduce the traffic volume efficiently.\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"Despite of having limited areas to live\", \"type\": \"preposition error\", \"fix\": \"Despite having limited areas to live\"}, {\"span\": \"the unthinkable traffic congestion of the city\", \"type\": \"word choice error\", \"fix\": \"the severe traffic congestion in the city\"}, {\"span\": \"is causing due to the increased population\", \"type\": \"grammatical error\", \"fix\": \"is caused by the increased population\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Use more varied vocabulary to express ideas, such as replacing 'high traffic volume' with 'significant traffic congestion'.\", \"Avoid using phrases like 'despite of' which are incorrect;

To what extent do you agree or disagree?\n\nScore this IELTS Task 2 essay according to the rubric, ensuring alignment with the question:\n\nThere have been significant developments in relation to communication in recent years, however it is often argued that this technological progress had had a detrimental effect on many people’s relationships. Although in numerous cases damage is being done to social interactions, I also strongly maintain that there are undeniable benefits that have been brought by internet-based methods of communication.\nCorresponding online can clearly be a hindrance in many situations. The principal drawback is that social websites such as Facebook can be very addictive, therefore people spend less time communicating face to face. It is commonplace to see group of friends or family members who are gathered together in a social situation, however their main focus is frequently their smartphones. Secondly, the anonymous nature of online communications can also be very damaging. Due to the fact that posts and group messages are often sent without the recipient knowing the sender personally, users are frequently more thoughtless, or even abusive, compared to what they can be held accountable for their words.\nDespite the aforementioned harmful aspects, the latest communication devices are also advantageous in a variety of respects. Firstly, prior to the introduction of the internet, there were limited opportunities to keep in contact with others. Many examples have been seen of childhood friends who lost contact as a result of moving to a new town or attending a diffrerent university. With the introduction of social networking, this situation is now easily avoidable. In addition, social media also provides opportunities to build new relationships with likeminded people. By taking advantage of social groups and mutual friend recommendations, connections can now be built anywhere across the world. Looking back 20 years, it was uncommon for friends to be made outside of a local community.\nTo conclude, there is no doubt that communication methods have been revolutionised over the last two decades. Whether this progression benefits or harms people socially, however, depending largely on individual circumstances. To avoid the potential issues presented above, it is vital that sufficient time is also devoted to more traditional forms of socialising.\n\nProvide your assessment in the specified JSON format."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"per_criterion\": [{\"name\": \"Task Response\", \"band\": 7.0, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"there are undeniable benefits that have been brought by internet-based methods of communication\", \"the anonymous nature of online communications can also be very damaging\", \"there is no doubt that communication methods have been revolutionised over the last two decades\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"group of friends or family members\", \"type\": \"grammatical\", \"fix\": \"a group of friends or family members\"}, {\"span\": \"diffrerent university\", \"type\": \"spelling\", \"fix\": \"different university\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Provide more specific examples to support claims about the benefits of internet-based communication.\", \"Clarify the conclusion by summarizing the main points discussed in the essay.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Coherence & Cohesion\", \"band\": 6.0, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"the anonymous nature of online communications can also be very damaging\", \"this situation is now easily avoidable\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"Whether this progression benefits or harms people socially, however, depending largely on individual circumstances.\", \"type\": \"sentence structure\", \"fix\": \"Change to 'Whether this progression benefits or harms people socially depends largely on individual circumstances.'\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Use clearer topic sentences at the beginning of each paragraph to guide the reader through the argument.\", \"Ensure consistent use of linking words to improve the flow between sentences and ideas.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Lexical Resource\", \"band\": 6.0, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"the anonymous nature of online communications can also be very damaging\", \"this technological progress had had a detrimental effect on many people’s relationships\", \"connections can now be built anywhere across the world\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"group of friends\", \"type\": \"article usage\", \"fix\": \"a group of friends\"}, {\"span\": \"diffrerent university\", \"type\": \"spelling error\", \"fix\": \"different university\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Use a wider range of vocabulary to express ideas more precisely and avoid repetition.\", \"Pay attention to spelling and grammatical accuracy to enhance clarity and professionalism.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Grammatical Range & Accuracy\", \"band\": 7.0, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"there are undeniable benefits that have been brought by internet-based methods of communication\", \"the anonymous nature of online communications can also be very damaging\", \"it is vital that sufficient time is also devoted to more traditional forms of socialising\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"group of friends or family members\", \"type\": \"article usage\", \"fix\": \"a group of friends or family members\"}, {\"span\": \"diffrerent university\", \"type\": \"spelling error\", \"fix\": \"different university\"}, {\"span\": \"depending largely on individual circumstances\", \"type\": \"subject-verb agreement\", \"fix\": \"depends largely on individual circumstances\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Ensure correct article usage by using 'a' before singular countable nouns.\", \"Proofread for spelling errors to maintain professionalism and clarity.\", \"Maintain subject-verb agreement to enhance grammatical accuracy.\"]}], \"overall\": 6.5, \"votes\": [6.5, 6.5, 6.5], \"dispersion\": 0.0, \"confidence\": \"high\", \"meta\": {\"prompt_hash\": \"training_data\", \"model\": \"training\", \"schema_version\": \"v1\", \"rubric_version\": \"rubric/v1\", \"token_usage\": {\"input_tokens\": 366, \"output_tokens\": 500}}}"}]}

A school of thought holds that graduates should find a job after finishing their studies. In general, both viewpoints do have their advantages and disadvantages. However, I personally lean toward the first opinion. \n\nA huge number of high school seniors seek employment after their graduation because they believe that attending university is nonsensical. Students think that it is better to get a job and save money as soon as possible instead of spending several years at school, which may not help them to earn higher salaries. For example, there are a significant number of bachelor’s degree holders working outside their field or even become unemployed person. Moreover, teenagers are supposed to believe that the more working experiences they have, the more money they can earn. For instance, experienced individuals are given priority by most companies rather than new graduates. \n\nOn the other hand, people pursuing tertiary education probably could stand a better chance of getting high-paid jobs. Students can attain advanced and specialized knowledge during their years of university education. For example, employers definitely give priority to candidates with relevant work qualifications rather than those without degrees. Furthermore, during the period of studying at university, there would be more quality relationships that might be beneficial for the future careers of undergraduates. Especially, when people encounter difficulties in their work, I believe, having many good relationships could open up more opportunities for them.\n\nIn conclusion, While some assert that students should start a job right away to gather as much experience as possible, I firmly believe that schooling is the most effective and easiest way to success.\n\nProvide your assessment in the specified JSON format."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"per_criterion\": [{\"name\": \"Task Response\", \"band\": 7.5, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"However, I personally lean toward the first opinion.\", \"On the other hand, people pursuing tertiary education probably could stand a better chance of getting high-paid jobs.\", \"I firmly believe that schooling is the most effective and easiest way to success.\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"the more working experiences they have\", \"type\": \"clarity\", \"fix\": \"the more work experience they have\"}, {\"span\": \"become unemployed person\", \"type\": \"grammar\", \"fix\": \"become unemployed\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Provide more specific examples to support the advantages of higher education.\", \"Clarify the conclusion by summarizing the main points discussed in the essay.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Coherence & Cohesion\", \"band\": 6.5, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"A huge number of high school seniors seek employment after their graduation because they believe that attending university is nonsensical.\", \"On the other hand, people pursuing tertiary education probably could stand a better chance of getting high-paid jobs.\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"While some assert that students should start a job right away to gather as much experience as possible\", \"type\": \"inconsistency\", \"fix\": \"Change 'While' to 'Although' for better contrast with the previous statement.\"}, {\"span\": \"Moreover, teenagers are supposed to believe that the more working experiences they have, the more money they can earn.\", \"type\": \"clarity\", \"fix\": \"Rephrase to 'Moreover, teenagers believe that having more work experience leads to higher earnings.' for clarity.\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Use clearer transition words to improve the flow between contrasting ideas.\", \"Ensure that each paragraph has a clear topic sentence to guide the reader on the main idea.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Lexical Resource\", \"band\": 6.5, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"attending higher education is actually the best way to become closer to a successful career\", \"students think that it is better to get a job and save money as soon as possible instead of spending several years at school\", \"having many good relationships could open up more opportunities for them\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"become unemployed person\", \"type\": \"word form error\", \"fix\": \"become unemployed people\"}, {\"span\": \"the more working experiences they have\", \"type\": \"plurality error\", \"fix\": \"the more work experience they have\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Use a wider range of vocabulary to express ideas more precisely and avoid repetition.\", \"Pay attention to word forms and plurality to ensure grammatical accuracy.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Grammatical Range & Accuracy\", \"band\": 7.5, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"A huge number of high school seniors seek employment after their graduation because they believe that attending university is nonsensical.\", \"Students can attain advanced and specialized knowledge during their years of university education.\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"become unemployed person\", \"type\": \"article usage\", \"fix\": \"become unemployed persons\"}, {\"span\": \"While some assert that students should start a job right away\", \"type\": \"capitalization\", \"fix\": \"while some assert that students should start a job right away\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Vary sentence structures by incorporating more complex sentences to enhance the overall grammatical range.\", \"Ensure consistency in pluralization and article usage to improve accuracy.\"]}], \"overall\": 7.0, \"votes\": [7.0, 7.0, 7.0], \"dispersion\": 0.0, \"confidence\": \"high\", \"meta\": {\"prompt_hash\": \"training_data\", \"model\": \"training\", \"schema_version\": \"v1\", \"rubric_version\": \"rubric/v1\", \"token_usage\": {\"input_tokens\": 324, \"output_tokens\": 500}}}"}]}

Others think it will lead to loss of respect and discipline in the classroom.\r\n\r\nDiscuss both views and give your opinion.\n\nScore this IELTS Task 2 essay according to the rubric, ensuring alignment with the question:\n\nIn today's modern era, some people argue that students should be allowed to make recommendations and even criticize their teachers.While others think that it could lead to losing discipline and respect in the classroom, I personally believe that it is better for educators to give comments to their teachers.\r\n\r\nOn the one hand, there are two main reasons why this idea would lead to a lack of respect and discipline. The first reason is that most students are too immature to objectively evaluate their teachers, which would lead to completely emotional evaluations without fairness. For example, teachers normally reprimand and punish naughty students when they stray, but given the chance to evaluate, these students would use it to get back at their teachers. In addition, many students will judge their teachers' work as poor because teachers are strict. The second one is that when there are enormous comments, a classroom would be chaos. Because opinions vary from student to student, it would be impractical to choose a teaching way that can be suitable and satisfy all people.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, I believe that making comments to educators is beneficial for education. Firstly, if pupils are allowed to give feedback to their teachers, educators would identify their strengths and weaknesses. This can help them improve their pedagogical skills and have good syllabuses in the future. Secondly, feedback is good for pupils, because it makes them feel fully engaged in their education. In fact, the level of comprehension of them depends on the way teachers implement, not on the content of the lesson. For instance, if students are slow, it might be ineffective for teachers teaching to fast. Therefore, giving feedback can help them completely understand their lessons.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, although making comments in classrooms might lead to disrespect, I believe that it brings many advantages outweighing drawbacks for educational quality.\n\nProvide your assessment in the specified JSON format."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"per_criterion\": [{\"name\": \"Task Response\", \"band\": 7.0, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"I personally believe that it is better for educators to give comments to their teachers.\", \"I believe that making comments to educators is beneficial for education.\", \"although making comments in classrooms might lead to disrespect, I believe that it brings many advantages outweighing drawbacks for educational quality.\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"it is better for educators to give comments to their teachers\", \"type\": \"clarity\", \"fix\": \"clarify that students should give feedback to teachers, not the other way around\"}, {\"span\": \"a classroom would be chaos\", \"type\": \"exaggeration\", \"fix\": \"use a more measured term, such as 'disorganization' or 'confusion'\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Clarify the main argument by explicitly stating that students should provide feedback to teachers rather than the reverse.\", \"Provide more specific examples or evidence to support the claim that feedback improves educational quality.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Coherence & Cohesion\", \"band\": 6.0, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"I personally believe that it is better for educators to give comments to their teachers.\", \"this idea would lead to a lack of respect and discipline.\", \"making comments in classrooms might lead to disrespect, I believe that it brings many advantages outweighing drawbacks for educational quality.\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"given the chance to evaluate, these students would use it to get back at their teachers.\", \"type\": \"logical flow\", \"fix\": \"Clarify the connection between students' evaluations and their motivations to ensure a smoother logical flow.\"}, {\"span\": \"the way teachers implement, not on the content of the lesson.\", \"type\": \"sentence structure\", \"fix\": \"Rephrase to improve clarity, e.g., 'the way teachers implement lessons, rather than the content itself.'\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Use clearer topic sentences at the beginning of each paragraph to guide the reader through the argument.\", \"Ensure that transitions between ideas are more explicit to enhance the overall flow of the essay.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Lexical Resource\", \"band\": 6.0, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"students should be allowed to make recommendations and even criticize their teachers\", \"this idea would lead to a lack of respect and discipline\", \"giving feedback can help them completely understand their lessons\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"teachers normally reprimand and punish naughty students\", \"type\": \"word choice\", \"fix\": \"teachers typically reprimand and discipline unruly students\"}, {\"span\": \"it would be impractical to choose a teaching way that can be suitable and satisfy all people\", \"type\": \"word form\", \"fix\": \"it would be impractical to choose a teaching method that can be suitable and satisfy everyone\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Use more varied vocabulary to express ideas, such as synonyms for 'teachers' and 'students'.\", \"Improve precision in word choice to enhance clarity and appropriateness of terms used.\", \"Incorporate more complex sentence structures to demonstrate a higher level of lexical resource.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Grammatical Range & Accuracy\", \"band\": 7.0, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"I personally believe that it is better for educators to give comments to their teachers.\", \"if pupils are allowed to give feedback to their teachers, educators would identify their strengths and weaknesses.\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"it could lead to losing discipline and respect in the classroom\", \"type\": \"tense consistency\", \"fix\": \"it could lead to a loss of discipline and respect in the classroom\"}, {\"span\": \"the level of comprehension of them depends on the way teachers implement\", \"type\": \"word order\", \"fix\": \"the level of their comprehension depends on the way teachers implement\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Vary sentence structures to include more complex and compound sentences.\", \"Ensure consistent use of articles and prepositions for clarity.\"]}], \"overall\": 6.5, \"votes\": [6.5, 6.5, 6.5], \"dispersion\": 0.0, \"confidence\": \"high\", \"meta\": {\"prompt_hash\": \"training_data\", \"model\": \"training\", \"schema_version\": \"v1\", \"rubric_version\": \"rubric/v1\", \"token_usage\": {\"input_tokens\": 355, \"output_tokens\": 500}}}"}]}

Nowadays, individuals' career and their position in society have great importance. Everyone tries to enhance their performance and get promoted; therefore, having a baby is a huge obstacle and prevents parents from reaching their goals. What's more, people without children have freedom. In other words, they do whatever they want and enjoy their lives. For example, a single person can travel or go to parties anytime without worrying about her baby.\r\n\r\nHowever, having children at an older age has significant drawbacks. First of all, old parents' offspring may suffer some disorders like Down syndrome. This problem is more common among old mothers' children, which causes irreparable problems in society. Secondly, older parents are not energetic, and they can't play with their babies properly. They get bored easily, and in the future, because of a huge age difference, they can't understand children, and this causes a disparity between them. For instance, teens with young parents have a good relationship with them.\r\n\r\nTo conclude, having a baby in old age has various reasons, like the importance of job prospects and liberty.

That is caused for two main reasons that I am going to explain in this essay and also give some solutions.\r\n\r\nFirstly, the main reason for this situation is the rising population living in the world. Every day the amount of earth's population is dramatically growing, especially, with the constant evolution in the field of medicine. Because of that people's life expectancy is rising and there is always a need for new houses and roads to be built, since more and more people are using cars to move around. \r\n\r\nMoreover, with economic development someone could be more easily able to afford a car, which may be more convenient for them to get to their work instead of using a bus. \r\n\r\nTo solve this problem the governments should promote and develop more public transportation, since in that way more people can avoid using the roads in their own vehicles.

Firstly, the government has to make the rules and regulations of traffic jams very strict. Secondly, those who will not follow these rules have to give a huge amount of fines.

Discuss both views and give your opinion.\n\nScore this IELTS Task 2 essay according to the rubric, ensuring alignment with the question:\n\nIn the present age, whether art subject is a valid subject rather than a waste of time has sparked much debate. Some people assert that art class is crucial for a child’s development, whereas many others argue that it is just a wasted effort. I tend to believe that art is as important as other subjects. \r\n\r\nThe primary factor we need to take into consideration is that art is escapism. Generally, students tend to get burned out as a result of more important lessons such as math, mother tongue, and history. Also in those “valid” subjects students get put into brackets, they have only one way to do exercises, and that way is dictated to them by teachers. For those reasons, subjects like art are a form of relaxation. There, pupils can express their feelings through painting and loosen up from previous lessons. \r\n\r\nIn contrast, parents usually take art classes as a joke and pressure their kids to only focus on those “valid” lessons because society does not accept art as a good future perspective. Nowadays the only “real” specialties are related to math, biology, and physics, so when parents admit their children into school they expect good grades in math and other important lessons but the little kids can not focus on the subject their parents want them to focus on and that leads to worse grades in both subjects. Moreover, parents get mad at children and force them to prioritize not the “relaxing” lessons but the ones that they think are more prospective. \r\n\r\nHaving considered both views, I believe that art is as important and a “real” subject as other lessons.

To what extent do you agree or disagree?\n\nScore this IELTS Task 2 essay according to the rubric, ensuring alignment with the question:\n\nIncreasing the cost of fuel to decrease environmental pollution is a popular idea in many countries. In my opinion, while higher fuel costs may have certain effects, there are numerous methods to improve the environment. \r\n\r\nOn the one hand, there are certain reasons why increasing the cost of fuel is beneficial. First, this may help reduce air pollution from vehicles. This is mainly because if the cost of fuel rises, people will use fewer personal vehicles. As a result, emissions from vehicles may decrease. For example, during the Covid-19 pandemic, people rarely use vehicles, so air pollution is significantly reduced. Second, the amount of pollution from many factories may fall. The main reason is that when the price of fuels increases, many factories will use different power sources which are environmentally friendly such as solar energy or wind power.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the government should adopt other methods to resolve environmental issues. To begin with, investing in public transport may be an effective way. When the public transport system is developed and modern, more people will use public transport. Therefore, the problem of air pollution may be lessened. Moreover, planting new forests and protecting current ones also help protect the environment. Every year, trees absorb a large amount of carbon dioxide and release oxygen into the environment. Also, the air may be fresh and conditioned by trees. Therefore, people should exploit forests rationally and prevent forest fires. \r\n\r\nIn conclusion, although increasing the cost of fuel has a lot of benefits, the government should care about different factors affecting the environment.\n\nProvide your assessment in the specified JSON format."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"per_criterion\": [{\"name\": \"Task Response\", \"band\": 7.5, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"increasing the cost of fuel to decrease environmental pollution is a popular idea in many countries.\", \"the government should adopt other methods to resolve environmental issues.\", \"investing in public transport may be an effective way.\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"the problem of air pollution may be lessened\", \"type\": \"vagueness\", \"fix\": \"provide specific examples of how public transport reduces air pollution\"}, {\"span\": \"the government should care about different factors affecting the environment\", \"type\": \"lack of clarity\", \"fix\": \"clarify what these different factors are and how they relate to the main argument\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Include more specific examples or data to support claims about the effectiveness of increasing fuel costs.\", \"Clarify and expand on the alternative methods to improve the environment to strengthen the argument.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Coherence & Cohesion\", \"band\": 6.5, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"this may help reduce air pollution from vehicles\", \"the government should adopt other methods to resolve environmental issues\", \"the problem of air pollution may be lessened\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"people rarely use vehicles, so air pollution is significantly reduced\", \"type\": \"tense inconsistency\", \"fix\": \"people rarely used vehicles, so air pollution was significantly reduced\"}, {\"span\": \"the air may be fresh and conditioned by trees\", \"type\": \"vague language\", \"fix\": \"the air may be kept fresh and clean by trees\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Use consistent verb tenses throughout the essay to improve clarity.\", \"Clarify vague phrases to enhance understanding and precision.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Lexical Resource\", \"band\": 6.5, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"the amount of pollution from many factories may fall\", \"investing in public transport may be an effective way\", \"trees absorb a large amount of carbon dioxide and release oxygen into the environment\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"people rarely use vehicles\", \"type\": \"tense inconsistency\", \"fix\": \"people rarely used vehicles\"}, {\"span\": \"the air may be fresh and conditioned by trees\", \"type\": \"word choice\", \"fix\": \"the air may be fresh and purified by trees\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Use a wider range of vocabulary to express ideas more precisely.\", \"Ensure consistent verb tenses throughout the essay to maintain clarity.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Grammatical Range & Accuracy\", \"band\": 7.5, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"this may help reduce air pollution from vehicles.\", \"the problem of air pollution may be lessened.\", \"the government should care about different factors affecting the environment.\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"people rarely use vehicles\", \"type\": \"tense consistency\", \"fix\": \"people rarely used vehicles\"}, {\"span\": \"the air may be fresh and conditioned by trees\", \"type\": \"word choice\", \"fix\": \"the air may be fresh and purified by trees\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Ensure consistent verb tenses throughout the essay.\", \"Consider using more precise vocabulary to enhance clarity and accuracy.\"]}], \"overall\": 7.0, \"votes\": [7.0, 7.0, 7.0], \"dispersion\": 0.0, \"confidence\": \"high\", \"meta\": {\"prompt_hash\": \"training_data\", \"model\": \"training\", \"schema_version\": \"v1\", \"rubric_version\": \"rubric/v1\", \"token_usage\": {\"input_tokens\": 288, \"output_tokens\": 500}}}"}]}

From my perspective, we need to put in efforts to mitigate this issue before it's exacerbated. I will share my viewpoint in the upcoming paragraphs\n\nTo commence with, the carbon footprint should be monitored across all the nations. In other words, the government officials could impose penalties on the citizens crossing the threshold of carbon limits. Consequently, individuals would consciously change their lifestyles. For instance, for commuting, they may switch from private to public transportation. Thus, this will purge emissions in some quantities and help in tackling extreme weather issues.\n\nFurthermore, schools should focus on  environmental studies. To elaborate on this, if adolescents are aware of the rising problems as shared by their teachers about irregular temperature then they will feel responsible towards the environment. For example, a tree plantation drive or a beach clean-up could  help teenagers to be accountable. Hence, with their mindful behaviour, preventing climate change will be easier.\n\nTo sum up, we can avert the effects on weather by reducing the release of carbon dioxide gases.

However, some people think that the government should spend more money on education for the adult population who cannot read and write. To what extent do you agree or disagree?\n\nScore this IELTS Task 2 essay according to the rubric, ensuring alignment with the question:\n\nIn recent years, whether education for the young is vital in nations has sparked much debate. Some people assert that countries should mainly focus on people from a young age, whereas others argue that the government should allocate more money to educating the adult group who do not have the ability to read and write. From my perspective, I strongly believe that money should be spent on helping illiterate adults to learn.\n\nOn the one hand, it is undoubtedly vital to focus on educating children from a young age since it will provide opportunities for the youth to develop their fundamental knowledge, therefore decreasing the number of illiterate citizens in the future. Furthermore, education in schools has been the main priority in multiple nations throughout the past few decades to enhance the country’s workforce. For example, in Vietnam, the government spends billions of dollars, which is nearly 10% of the country’s GDP, on the education field each year with the purpose of funding the young generation, therefore developing the economy in the future. \n\nOn the other hand, countries deciding to invest in millennials who do not know how to write and read will reap financial rewards. This is because the investment will bring a better-educated workforce, thus fostering the growth of the economy and the country’s development. With the main concentration on illiterate adults, the corollary of this would be a sustainable economy and a better society.

Thus, the individual gets rejected as they do not need a book, but a human engine to run their machines. Furthermore, other criteria to qualify is, communication skills. For example, if a product is needed to be sold, then the buyers should be provided with as best offer as possible, just for company profit. Whatever, the business it is running, the best way to buy or sell products is negotiation with the way of talking and persuading them with some schemes.

My essay will outline a number of reasons for this trend and a number of its associated solutions.\n\nTo begin with, the increase in production of consumer products that harm the environment. When more goods are produced, more waste and toxic emissions are released from factories into nature. Water sources are polluted and air is seriously polluted, leading to harmful to humans and the death of many marine and terrestrial animals. For example, in Vietnam, when the Vinh Tan thermal power plant increased its electricity production, it caused extremely serious environmental pollution, affecting surrounding people, and columns of black smoke were continuously released. Therefore, leading to serious air pollution for surrounding people. Meanwhile, growing production of wares will consume a lot of materials. For instance, in a rural area of ​​China, a large number of trees are cut down in the forest to put into factories to produce house construction materials and tools. Consequently, This directly affects the ecological balance and habitat of many animal species.\n\nHowever, there are some possible solutions that can solve this problem. Firstly, companies should promote the use of more environmentally friendly materials. For example, coffee giant Starbucks recently replaced plastic straws with reusable alternatives made from materials such as paper or bamboo. Secondly, regulators need to enforce strict regulations on the consumer goods industry. For example, they can impose heavy fines on these manufacturing companies for littering or polluting the local environment, which can protect the local environment from being polluted by irresponsible behavior. of these companies.\n\nIn conclusion, although this trend has a negative impact on the environment, there are still some possible solutions to solve this problem.\n\nProvide your assessment

There is an argument, whether the parents should be responsible for their children’s actions or not. Although parents are majorly responsible for their offspring’s actions, I entirely harbour the perspective that lawbreakers would be accountable for their offences and ought to be punished.\r\n\r\nTo commence with, parents should be punished if their child does any crime as there are a huge number of cases are stemming from lack of parent’s attention and love towards their children. Nowadays, parents are working day and night in order to earn a luxurious livelihood for their wards, but it affects terribly on their children as it will have detrimental impacts on their cognitive development, and they would be more likely to indulge in anti-social activities. \r\n\r\nHowever, I still hold the firm belief that children who commit crime should also receive deserving punishments. Firstly, when the young offenders are punished with having custody and serve community service, they would deeply understand the seriousness of their wrongdoing and feel regretful. To be precise more, by conducting punishments, young people can be well-educated about the cost of crime committing and will never repeat the same mistake in future. For instance, if parents will take all the blame on themselves, it will have misled impacts on their offsprings, which force them to understand that if they commit any wrong actions, it will not bother them. Hence, deserving punishments should be given to them to alleviate the causes of juvenile delinquency in the long run.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, even though parents are responsible for their children’s offences, the lawbreakers ought to be solely answerable for their crimes.

Some people claim that teenaged students ought to participate in local communities services freely for their social experience. I personally agree with this educational idea because of the benefits in the long term for the students.\r\n\r\nNeedless to say, the diverse experiences of one's youth build up their uniqueness and broaden their horizons. When teens select their major in universities or their career, it is quite normal not to have a certain idea of what they would pursue due to the lack of knowledge. Therefore, participating in a free association would be one of the valuable opportunities because they can deepen their understanding of how society works. For example, as a consequence of signing up for a tree planting voluntary, a student might get interested in environmental studies.　\r\n\r\nThere are also multiple benefits from societies' perspective. Firstly, most of the organization require workforces. Thus, students who likely have ample free time would be a great help for them and their advanced knowledge about modern technology might be able to improve the community. Secondly, it is impossible to maintain social supports without the younger generations' assistances since they have to take over the system in the future, and if the different generation could build a bond, the societies would be more robust.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, I agree with this statement. From my volunteer experiences as a student, they have helped me to understand several social issues and expand my social circle.

Humans are known to be deficient in some of the things they require for their basic needs, hence, the need to exchange what one possesses in return for what he needs. This can been expressed also among countries as each country has its own resources and may depend on other countries to get what they are lacking. For example, the international relationship between the USA and Nigeria has promoted the trade of crude oil and its products among these nations.In addition, mutual interest in trade stands as a protection for the regions involved. Communities are more interested in building business connections with other communities because of the peace that it may provide. This prevents the economic disruption that may face both countries if they are at war with each other. An example of this can be seen in the relationships between China and other countries.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand , one of the major points that suggests that international relationships are more favourable towards keeping the environment safe is the fact that it unifies the pursuit towards a better climate. With data and contributions from different regions, all aspects of the ecosystem will be properly addressed in order to manage the problems perculiar to each region.

Therefor, to improve road safely, people should pay more attention to find out the reasons what make the roas isn't safe.\n\nThe main reason that can make more accidents is from aware and responsibilities of each other people. In specific, if the governments are able to ban the policies or manage stricly with the unlaw actions of driving, but the citizens don't follow these, the figures of consllitions of traffic still rise. Futhermore, from people's aware, accommulating the knowledge on traffic is necessary in the modern world because they need to know about the laws and carry out these to save themselve and develop their country. For instance, people when join in the traffic don't break the law means that the number of polices also recline and governments can focus on developing their country with the best way. \n\nIn conclusion, for these reasons i have mention above i think that, it is more and more ways to keep the safe on the road with the right actions of the government and individual, in the future, the accident or consllitions will fall suddenly.\n\nProvide your assessment in the specified JSON format."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"per_criterion\": [{\"name\": \"Task Response\", \"band\":

To what extent do you think are consumers influenced by advertisements? What measures can be taken to protect them?\n\nScore this IELTS Task 2 essay according to the rubric, ensuring alignment with the question:\n\nLiving in a century that is influenced materialistically, we are inundated with an array of advertisements. In my opinion, the excess practice of it, whether on TV, internet or print media, could be menacing as it invigorates people to spend more without thinking cautiously. Hence, there should be some protective measures to avert over-spending. In the following essays, I shall discuss this in detail.\n\nTo begin with, compelling advertising, showcasing attractive products and services, forces people to spend even when it is not necessary. In the present scenario, companies with massive budgets have adopted varying methods to advertise their offering, ranging from TV commercials to flyers in newspaper that it is becoming strenuous for people to escape from these activities. For instance, if you are watching a cricket match, it is very likely that you will come across logos or advertisements of sponsors. Similarly, if you are watching a web series or a movie, you will find a promotional product. At the very least, even if you are just scrolling through social media in your free time, you will find hoards of advertisements or influencers promoting products. This volume of advertising simply means that we, as consumers, are profoundly cajoled into purchasing such products without giving them enough thought.\n\nAs far as the regulation is concerned, it is not a piece of cake to decide how the advertisements can be regulated. Evidently, governments have to restrict advertisements for such products that could pose health threats or are harmful, such as tobacco, alcohol, and more. Considering that the government doesn’t have significant control over other advertising forms, consumers will have to use their common sense. This includes brainstorming over the need of a product than giving up in front of the desires or wants. Waiting for 24-hours before buying a product can help as well. This means not scrolling through products on the internet mindlessly or not giving in to the temptation of buying the latest smartphone.\n\nIn the end, it could be concluded that while it is difficult to escape entirely from advertisements and their effects, people should control their urges to purchase anything unnecessarily.\n\nProvide your assessment in the specified JSON format."}, {"role":

timeline.By building more apartments and giving loans it helps to mitigate the problems of housing in towns.For example an apartment can accommodate a tremendously higher number of individuals than a house which occupies and wastes land.Furthermore the government can introduce new home zones in virgin lands which are nearby the metropolitan.This is done to empower individuals who want to build houses and are unable to purchase land or apartments in the city.As a result it helps to decongest the number of people in towns and provides solutions to housing problems.\n\nAlso the government should give incentives to small builders to enter the market of constructing houses as independent builders.Likewise this helps people who are unable to afford professional builders to build their homes.In doing so the government will be increasing the number of houses for it's citizens.\n\nIn conclusion ,I believe that it is the government's main responsibility to curb the lack of homes in the

From my perspective, I agree with the latter.\r\n\r\nTo start with, some people hold the view that the damages caused by human activities to wildlife are irreversible. The major reason is many species of plants and animals are disappeared from our planet, and it is impossible to get them back. For example, polar bears are not able to take a break while swimming because there are no lands for them to do that as the glaciers are melting due to global warming. Meanwhile, human activity is the main cause of global warming. Hence, in those people's opinions, nothing can be done to tackle this problem.\r\n\r\nThe government should introduce new law about the restriction of deforestation. This is because the disappearance of forests will speed up the extinction of species. For instance, If the government outlawed deforestation, many people would not able to cut the plants which protect the habitat for animals to live. As a result, the variety of species is guaranteed. Similarly, individuals ought to raise their awareness of environmental issues, and spread it out to others. Therefore, reducing the bad influence on species of animals and plants is not a hard thing to do.\r\n\r\nIn summary, although there are some hardships for solving save the plants and animals who all are in danger, it is our responsibility to save the world from the negative influence.\n\nProvide your assessment in the specified JSON format."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"per_criterion\": [{\"name\": \"Task Response\", \"band\": 9.0, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"some people believe that it is already too late to take any reactions to this problem\", \"the government should introduce new law about the restriction of deforestation\", \"it is our responsibility to save the world from the negative influence\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"the worlds' empty lands that do not have any use of them\", \"type\": \"possessive error\", \"fix\": \"the world's empty lands that do not have any use\"}, {\"span\": \"many species of plants and animals are disappeared from our planet\", \"type\": \"tense error\", \"fix\": \"many species of plants and animals have disappeared from our planet\"}, {\"span\": \"If the government outlawed deforestation, many people would not able to cut the plants\", \"type\": \"missing word\", \"fix\": \"many people would not be able to cut the plants\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Clarify the argument by providing more specific examples of effective measures that can be taken.\", \"Ensure consistent use of tenses throughout the essay to enhance clarity.\", \"Improve sentence structure for better readability and coherence.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Coherence & Cohesion\", \"band\": 8.0, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"some people believe that it is already too late to take any reactions to this problem\", \"the disappearance of forests will speed up the extinction of species\", \"reducing the bad influence on species of animals and plants is not a hard thing to do\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"the worlds' empty lands that do not have any use of them\", \"type\": \"grammatical error\", \"fix\": \"the world's empty lands that have no use\"}, {\"span\": \"the damages caused by human activities to wildlife are irreversible\", \"type\": \"clarity issue\", \"fix\": \"the damage caused by human activities to wildlife is irreversible\"}, {\"span\": \"hardships for solving save the plants and animals who all are in danger\", \"type\": \"cohesion issue\", \"fix\": \"hardships in saving the plants and animals that are in danger\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Use clearer subject-verb agreements to enhance clarity.\", \"Ensure consistent use of singular and plural forms to avoid confusion.\", \"Improve transitions between ideas to enhance the flow of the essay.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Lexical Resource\", \"band\": 8.0, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"the disappearance of forests will speed up the extinction of species\", \"reducing the bad influence on species of animals and plants is not a hard thing to do\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"the worlds' empty lands\", \"type\": \"possessive error\", \"fix\": \"the world's empty lands\"}, {\"span\": \"the damages caused by human activities to wildlife are irreversible\", \"type\": \"word choice\", \"fix\": \"the damage caused by human activities to wildlife is irreversible\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Use more varied vocabulary to express ideas, such as synonyms for 'damage' and 'influence'.\", \"Ensure subject-verb agreement and correct possessive forms to enhance grammatical accuracy.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Grammatical Range & Accuracy\", \"band\": 9.0, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"some people hold the view that the damages caused by human activities to wildlife are irreversible.\", \"the disappearance of forests will speed up the extinction of species.\", \"reducing the bad influence on species of animals and plants is not a hard thing to do.\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"the worlds' empty lands\", \"type\": \"possessive error\", \"fix\": \"the world's empty lands\"}, {\"span\": \"many people would not able to cut the plants\", \"type\": \"missing auxiliary verb\", \"fix\": \"many people would not be able to cut the plants\"}, {\"span\": \"hardships for solving save the plants and animals\", \"type\": \"incorrect structure\", \"fix\": \"hardships in saving the plants and animals\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Ensure correct use of possessive forms to avoid confusion.\", \"Always include auxiliary verbs when forming negative constructions.\", \"Use appropriate prepositions and gerunds to improve sentence structure.\"]}], \"overall\": 8.5, \"votes\": [8.5, 8.5, 8.5], \"dispersion\": 0.0, \"confidence\": \"high\", \"meta\": {\"prompt_hash\": \"training_data\", \"model\": \"training\", \"schema_version\": \"v1\", \"rubric_version\": \"rubric/v1\", \"token_usage\": {\"input_tokens\": 348, \"output_tokens\": 500}}}"}]}

Technological advancements might lead to job replacements in some current areas. The demand for highly-skill workers in some fields such as artificial intelligence or data analysis increase whilst lower-skilled jobs may see reduced demand. As a result, people who do monotonous and repetitive jobs will lose their jobs and result in income inequalities. Furthermore, the limited access to technology among the disadvantaged hinder them from benefiting technological advancements. Many technological products are prohibitively expensive and only the rich can afford to buy them. \r\n\r\nOn the other hand, proponents of the opposing view contend that technological advancements are reducing income inequality. Technological change enables all individuals, irrespective socioeconomic background, to access education and services with affordable price. Consequently, the poor also have a better chance of landing a high-paid job, leading to increased income and a higher living of standard.

Some argue that only government is the appropriate authority to deal with this rising problem. I strongly agree with this argument as the government can solve this growing issue by various steps, such as restricting the new landed residential housing by encouraging vertical apartment buildings and gradually expanding the city.\n\nFirst and foremost, the government is the only appropriate authority to resolve this housing crisis issue by discouraging the building of new landed houses and encouraging vertical multi-storey apartment living with proper planning and infrastructure to deal with this space crunch. For example, Singapore and Hong Kong are the cities on an island, they have proven to solve this crisis for their citizens by vertically building thousands of high-floor flats. These cities have proved to have the best infrastructure for their ever-growing population by building multi-story apartments rather than new houses, which has resulted in economically affordable housing for their citizens in big cities. Further, to help the situation government can extend highways to help commuters access the city easily. This high level of planning can only be done by the government to help solve the accommodation shortages for their citizenry.\n\nSecondly, the government can help this situation by expanding the cities and creating more residential properties on the outskirts of the city. In the Noida, for instance,  a fast-growing city in India, the housing development board has continuously helped accommodate the growing population by building more residential properties on the outskirts of the city which eventually became part of the city and built metros and highways for commuters to make the city easily accessible. Hence, this helped in controlling growing cramping and accommodation problems for their locals. \n\nIn conclusion, it is clear that government has a big role to play as an ultimate authority by taking

The argument is divided into two perspectives, whether the importance of local history or world history. In my opinion, both of them have the same merits, and this essay will explain them in detail based on experience.\r\n\r\nLearning local history leads the students to know about the best practices used by their founders to rule the nations with the state systems and become developed countries. The students need to see this subject because, in the future, every nation will face some uncertainty problems where the decisions created by their founders could be considered to solve those problems in the future problem. For example, in Indonesia, the state systems have changed from the colonialization era to the new order era. At present, Indonesia has a stable system and is a democratic nation.

While there are some benefits to students getting a job straight, I believe that keep going to university or college is the best path to finding a satisfying career. In this essay, I will explain both sides in detail in the ensuing paragraphs.\n\nAdolescents getting a career directly after high school is attractive for several reasons. Firstly, a university degree is not necessary for some industries. In Taiwan, for example, there are a few managers for service professions who assume practical training is more important. In addition, these youth would gain more work experience, become more independent, and even start earning money sooner than other peers who are students.\n\nOn the other hand, I completely agree that it is more beneficial to young people for continuing their programs at university. The major reason is a degree can open the door to better employment prospects. For instance, most jobs, such as medical professions or engineering require academic qualifications, including specific knowledge and skills. Moreover, schools aim to teach teenagers moral values such as tolerance and sharing, which prepare them to be members of society.

Why? Advantages outweigh disadvantages?\n\nScore this IELTS Task 2 essay according to the rubric, ensuring alignment with the question:\n\nIn these days and ages, in some nations, residents have changed their minds when choosing to have offspring at a later age compared to the past. This essay will find out the reasons and clarify why the drawbacks outweigh the benefits.\r\n\r\nFirstly, when life costs increase, people decide to shift their priority from starting a family to establishing financial security which helps them to pay off basic needs including housing, food, transportation and healthcare services. Secondly, whereas women in the past were attributed as ones taking on roles of giving birth at the “right age”, this perception now has changed. In other words, females opt to pursue their careers, and personal goals and seek gender equality leading to a delay in starting a family. For example, a study conducted by the Demographic paper revealed that 7 in 10 women aged 30 – 35 said that they would not be ready to become moms unless they achieved their professional aspirations.\r\n\r\nDespite the aforementioned grounds, it is undeniable that raising children at a later age has some disadvantages excelling advantages. On the one hand, having offspring when getting older that individuals achieve financial stability and a strong financial foundation facilitating them to create a better environment for adolescents’ development and growth. It means that, their babies can join private schools with advanced education systems, resulting in positive performance which contributes to a qualified national workforce. On the other hand, giving birth late might cause some consequences related to children’s physical and mental health. Furthermore, it may result in a huge generation gap between parents and their sons or daughters, who are prone to be influenced by outside factors such as social media. As a result, parents need to talk to them regularly to provide appropriate guidance and advice helping to steer them from negative factors which older parents might struggle to solve.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, although selecting to have offspring at a later stage in life is based on reasonable factors such as establishing strong financial backgrounds, it has some detrimental effects on children’s lives which outweigh the positive aspects. It is predicted that if governments have appropriate assistance in raising children, communities will re-consider giving birth at a more suitable age due to the decrease in childcare burdens.\n\nProvide your assessment in the specified JSON format."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"per_criterion\": [{\"name\": \"Coherence & Cohesion\", \"band\": 6.0, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"this perception now has changed.\", \"it is undeniable that raising children at a later age has some disadvantages excelling advantages.\", \"governments have appropriate assistance in raising children\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"having offspring when getting older that individuals achieve financial stability\", \"type\": \"sentence structure\", \"fix\": \"Rephrase to: 'having offspring when getting older allows individuals to achieve financial stability.'\"}, {\"span\": \"it has some detrimental effects on children’s lives which outweigh the positive aspects.\", \"type\": \"clarity\", \"fix\": \"Clarify by rephrasing to: 'it has some detrimental effects on children’s lives that outweigh the positive aspects.'\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Use clearer transitions between ideas to enhance the flow of the essay.\", \"Ensure that sentences are structured correctly to improve clarity and coherence.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Task Response\", \"band\": 7.5, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"this essay will find out the reasons and clarify why the drawbacks outweigh the benefits.\", \"it is undeniable that raising children at a later age has some disadvantages excelling advantages.\", \"although selecting to have offspring at a later stage in life is based on reasonable factors such as establishing strong financial backgrounds, it has some detrimental effects on children’s lives which outweigh the positive aspects.\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"disadvantages excelling advantages\", \"type\": \"clarity\", \"fix\": \"disadvantages outweigh advantages\"}, {\"span\": \"it may result in a huge generation gap\", \"type\": \"specificity\", \"fix\": \"it may result in a significant generation gap\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Clarify the comparison between advantages and disadvantages more explicitly throughout the essay.\", \"Provide more specific examples or data to support the claims made about the drawbacks of having children later in life.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Lexical Resource\", \"band\": 6.5, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"residents have changed their minds when choosing to have offspring at a later age compared to the past\", \"this perception now has changed\", \"having offspring when getting older that individuals achieve financial stability\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"excelling advantages\", \"type\": \"word choice\", \"fix\": \"exceeding advantages\"}, {\"span\": \"appropriate guidance and advice helping to steer them from negative factors\", \"type\": \"redundancy\", \"fix\": \"appropriate guidance helping to steer them from negative factors\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Use more varied vocabulary to express similar ideas, avoiding repetition.\", \"Ensure clarity by avoiding redundancy in phrases.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Grammatical Range & Accuracy\", \"band\": 6.5, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"residents have changed their minds when choosing to have offspring at a later age compared to the past.\", \"this perception now has changed.\", \"having offspring when getting older that individuals achieve financial stability and a strong financial foundation facilitating them to create a better environment for adolescents’ development and growth.\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"having offspring when getting older that individuals achieve financial stability\", \"type\": \"sentence structure\", \"fix\": \"having offspring when getting older means that individuals achieve financial stability\"}, {\"span\": \"it is undeniable that raising children at a later age has some disadvantages excelling advantages.\", \"type\": \"word choice\", \"fix\": \"it is undeniable that raising children at a later age has some disadvantages exceeding advantages.\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Improve sentence structure by ensuring clarity and correct conjunction usage.\", \"Use more precise vocabulary to enhance clarity and accuracy in expression.\"]}], \"overall\": 7.0, \"votes\": [7.0, 7.0, 7.0], \"dispersion\": 0.0, \"confidence\": \"high\", \"meta\": {\"prompt_hash\": \"training_data\", \"model\": \"training\", \"schema_version\": \"v1\", \"rubric_version\": \"rubric/v1\", \"token_usage\": {\"input_tokens\": 397, \"output_tokens\": 500}}}"}]}

Each people have different views on how to improve road safety. While many people agree that give much stricter punishments on driving offenses is a good method, I strongly disagree that this is the only measure because there are alternative ways which are effective and need taking into account.\r\n\r\nOn the one hand, it is true that harsher penalties may discourage drivers from operating a vehicle recklessly or carefully. However, there are numerous causes of road accidents, such as poor infrastructure or environmental variables like fog, rain, or snow. The most frequent reason for traffic accidents is due to students' lack of awareness and knowledge of the rules of the road. Therefore, ensuring traffic safety is not necessary regardless of how much a fine is.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, I think there are a number of steps that can successfully increase road safety. First, rather than raising fines, the federal, state, and municipal governments should fund road repairs and infrastructure improvements like traffic lights and signs. Second, on busy or frequently congested highways, the authorities can install traffic cameras or boost the number of traffic enforcement officers. This, consequently, could raise the awareness of people about the need to follow the speed limits and traffic rules. In order to lessen the number of accidents brought on by mechanical issues or unlicensed drivers, it is also advisable to undergo routine vehicle inspections. To train people who can observe road safety laws, we also need to strictly regulate and increase the number of driving examinations. The most crucial issue, and particularly for teens who are more inclined to breach the law, is that people receive greater education about the value of road safety.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, I would affirm that this situation does not necessarily call for harsh sanctions.

I completely agree with this opinion due to the fact that a business's survival requires the support of the stakeholders.\r\n\r\nAccruing profits should not be the only goal of any investor. The reason is that there are many stakeholders in any investment and this range from shareholders to employees to local communities hosting the business to customers. Therefore, a business owner has large responsibility of satisfying these stakeholders. Though the primary aim of shareholders is to make gains, however, the hosting land will expect some positive impacts from the business. For example, an oil mining company is expected to contribute to the growth of its local community by achieving less pollution in the environment and also providing some social amenities in order to continue enjoying the support of the local community. Therefore, as an investor is trying to make money to satisfy the shareholders, he also needs to work hard to maintain strong support from the local community.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, a business owner also has a responsibility to customers. Customers consume the products and their aspirations need to be met. Customers can be grouped into two. There are retailers and final consumers. For instance, farmers in Australia supply to retail outlets for onward selling to final consumers or they sell directly to consumers. Therefore, a business owner must maintain a strong relationship with these groups, by making sure He is supplying quality products at affordable prices. This will make the business sustainable for its shareholders for continuous returns.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, as much as businesses must make profits, social responsibilities cannot be avoided if a business will survive for a long period of time.

The advantages to this are that they get work experience and proper saving for, paying their tuition fees and it also brings some disadvantages too.\nOne of a positive side of taking a gap before continuing higher education is getting a valuable work experience by doing part-time or full-time employment. It is true that in many countries a candidate with no experience always struggles to get a good job after finishing tertiary education, whereas, a candidate who has a small experience before entering university often does not struggle to get a job in future. Another positive aspect is saving of some fund. This is because the higher education is so costly that most students do not continue their education, and with such savings not only do they continue their studies, but also do not have to depend on their parents or bank for a loan.\nThere are many negative sides to this but one of them is losing interest to continue the studies. For example, in China, 65% of students who took a gap of 6 months or a year never came back for their further education due to an interest in earning money. Another downside is that getting involved in bad activities. It has seen in many western countries that few students who travel or work for a certain period seem to get involved in bad influences such as, drugs, shoplifting or robbery.\nIn conclusion, even

To what extend do you agree or disagree?\n\nScore this IELTS Task 2 essay according to the rubric, ensuring alignment with the question:\n\nThe issue related to the complexity of technology and living without it has been heatedly debated by users in recent years. Some feel that the daily routine can be simplified excluding the technology. In my opinion, I totally disagree with those who say that technology should be reduced from life. However, the usage of technological devices without parent supervision has negative impacts on children’s education.\r\nRegarding those who hold that excluding technology can simplify life, there are many reasons. One supportive claim is that using technological devices without parent supervision can have negative impacts on children´s education. Furthermore, children are unable to manage their time using smartphones or tablets. It is also possible those parents are anti-technology because of a lack of knowledge. To illustrate, they are not able to set up a password to control the children´s initial access. \r\nNevertheless, I firmly believe that opinion is ludicrous. The obvious reason is that technology has significant effects on people's communication. It is also possible to say that instant communication and internet mobile is vital for business interaction. Moreover, using the internet most of the students can have classes from home and employees can do home office. A typical example is in order to control the spread of Coronavirus, during the self-isolation in Canada most people are working from home using a notebook and internet.\r\nTo sum up, I maintain that technological advancements are vital for social communication. The only concern is about children using cellphones and tablets without adult monitoring.

To say that the internet revolutionized our lives is an understatement. It has made it possible for us to perform just about anything with a few clicks of a button.

All of those mundane tasks can now be performed within a few seconds. The biggest advantage of the internet is that we can carry it around because it works on a variety of devices of all sizes and shapes. Obviously, it is quite normal for a generation that grew up using the internet from their childhood to want to get everything done in seconds.\n\nHowever, this insistence on getting instant support or response can be positive or negative depending upon our access to technology. The internet has certainly made our lives comfortable and faster. It has allowed us to save a lot time. However, like any other technology, the internet technology can also fail us from time to time. Connection speeds vary from place to place. Also, the reliability is not the same throughout the day. It is not uncommon for people addicted to instant gratification to panic when they lose connectivity. This is a common problem when city people visit rural areas where the internet is either slow or inaccessible.\n\nTo conclude, if the present generation wants to get everything done instantly, that is because they grew up using the internet technology.

There are negative effects on plants and animal species due to industrialization and urbanization. Some people believe that those negative effects cannot be tackled as people have realized it too late. However, other people argue that this situation can be improved with effective approaches. I would support the latter view.  \r\n\r\nOn the one hand, people believe that this problem cannot be solved because the negative effects that people have made are not reversible. For example, people are not able to make animal species that have died out become alive again. Even if people can preserve some endangered animals, those animals may not be able to survive in the harsh environment today. Hence, taking action now cannot solve the problem.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, I would argue that humans should take some actions to improve this situation because it is humans' responsibility to protect plants and animal species that are closely related to humans. If people do not pay attention to those negative effects, they will also be affected due to the imbalanced ecosystem. For instance, trees are critical in transforming carbon to woods and produce oxygen for people. If people lived on a planet without trees, they would face a problem with a lack of oxygen. Therefore, people should take their responsibility to protect plants and animals. \r\n\r\nIn conclusion, although some negative effects are irreversible, I would argue that it is people's responsibility to imply some effective measures to improve this situation because people are closely related to other species.\n\nProvide your assessment in the specified JSON format."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"per_criterion\": [{\"name\": \"Coherence & Cohesion\", \"band\": 6.0, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"people believe that this problem cannot be solved because the negative effects that people have made are not reversible.\", \"I would argue that humans should take some actions to improve this situation because it is humans' responsibility to protect plants and animal species that are closely related to humans.\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"imply some effective measures to improve this situation\", \"type\": \"word choice\", \"fix\": \"replace 'imply' with 'implement'\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Use more linking words and phrases to connect ideas more clearly, such as 'furthermore', 'in addition', or 'consequently'.\", \"Ensure that each paragraph has a clear topic sentence that summarizes the main idea to enhance coherence.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Task Response\", \"band\": 7.5, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"I would support the latter view.\", \"I would argue that humans should take some actions to improve this situation because it is humans' responsibility to protect plants and animal species that are closely related to humans.\", \"it is people's responsibility to imply some effective measures to improve this situation\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"imply some effective measures\", \"type\": \"word choice\", \"fix\": \"implement some effective measures\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Provide more specific examples of effective approaches that can be taken to improve the environmental situation.\", \"Clarify the argument by discussing potential solutions in more detail, rather than just stating that action is necessary.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Lexical Resource\", \"band\": 6.5, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"extensive attention has been put on environment issues\", \"humans should take some actions to improve this situation\", \"it is people's responsibility to imply some effective measures\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"imply some effective measures\", \"type\": \"word choice\", \"fix\": \"implement some effective measures\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Use a wider range of vocabulary to express ideas more precisely.\", \"Avoid repetition of phrases like 'negative effects' by using synonyms or paraphrasing.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Grammatical Range & Accuracy\", \"band\": 6.5, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"people believe that this problem cannot be solved\", \"humans should take some actions to improve this situation\", \"it is people's responsibility to imply some effective measures\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"imply some effective measures\", \"type\": \"word choice\", \"fix\": \"implement some effective measures\"}, {\"span\": \"transforming carbon to woods\", \"type\": \"preposition error\", \"fix\": \"transforming carbon into wood\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Use more varied sentence structures to enhance grammatical range.\", \"Ensure correct word choice to improve clarity and precision in meaning.\"]}], \"overall\": 7.0, \"votes\": [7.0, 7.0, 7.0], \"dispersion\": 0.0, \"confidence\": \"high\", \"meta\": {\"prompt_hash\": \"training_data\", \"model\": \"training\", \"schema_version\": \"v1\", \"rubric_version\": \"rubric/v1\", \"token_usage\": {\"input_tokens\": 303, \"output_tokens\": 500}}}"}]}

As far as I am concerned, there are two reasons that prove not only increasing the cost of fuel is affectless but also  can be damage for family financial. The illustration of these reasons is provided   below.\r\n\r\nThe primary negative point to take into account is family finance. There are many jobs that   require to use of personal transportation vehicles. When   the   cost of   fuel   is   increased  , people for the most probability  will be faced with financial difficulty.\r\n\r\n It can be further claimed that when people struggle against  poverty and they cannot provide daily needs so in this situation they never pay attention to the care of the environment . An example that will clarify the point is taxi drivers. The chief part of their job depends on cost of fuel so the high cost can be made it a hard condition for them.\r\n\r\nThe second substantial reason for the current discussion is the entertainment industry and tourism .In other words, a high percentage of travel is done with a personal vehicle. If people cannot purchase the fuel for their necessary needs perhaps they will   put    away unimportant expenses like travelling. For instance, there are many persons who  get  lower salaries than others like employees. They oblige to manage their income and spend most of their salary on essential requirements. So they will put travel in last preference. In this case, the tourism industry likely will experience high losses \r\n\r\nIn conclusion, there are various  solutions for solving the environmental crisis   But, it seems to me that enhancing the transportations cost like fuel is not logical and sensible.

Some people think that children going to single sex schools have disadvantages later in life.  To what extent do you agree?\n\nScore this IELTS Task 2 essay according to the rubric, ensuring alignment with the question:\n\nIt is commonly argued that children attending single-sex schools will be at a disadvantage in the long run. Personally, I can neither agree nor disagree with this statement for a variety of reasons.\r\n\r\nI partly agree with the opinion that co-ed schools provide better preparation in life for kids. This is because they allow for opposite-gender interactions to occur, mimicking what the real world has to offer. It's through these interactions that kids develop their emotional intelligence and interpersonal relationships, putting them in a better place in life. Due to being exposed to the other sex often, co-ed schools also play a role in helping build confidence around others along with communication skills which are important skills for later on in life. As an example, it has been shown by Yale that emotional intelligence is mainly cultivated through a person's school years  when a diverse group of people to connect with would help immensely in this process. \r\n\r\nOn the other hand, that is not to say that single-sex schools are inherently bad. The reason for this is that single-sex schools provide a comfortable and relaxed learning environment, as everyone shares the same mindset here, being of the same gender. This would reduce double standards and stereotypes, allowing kids to focus more on their education and studies. For example, research from Stanford pointed out how pupils of single-sex schools outperformed their co-ed counterparts by 5-10% in academic grades. Also, aside from the academic aspects of this education system, schools can also provide better mental and wellbeing support, as due to being of the same gender, certain problems unique to each sex can be directly addressed, improving the close-knit bond between teachers and students.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, although it's easy to say that single-sex education lacks diversity, which plays a role in a child's psychological development, it also acts as a way to provide a better learning environment for students, allowing them to achieve better scores in the future.\n\nProvide your assessment in the specified JSON format."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"per_criterion\": [{\"name\": \"Task Response\", \"band\": 8.0, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"I partly agree with the opinion that co-ed schools provide better preparation in life for kids.\", \"On the other hand, that is not to say that single-sex schools are inherently bad.\"], \"errors\": [], \"suggestions\": [\"Provide a clearer thesis statement that outlines the main points of discussion in the essay.\", \"Include more specific examples or evidence to support the claims made about both co-ed and single-sex schools.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Coherence & Cohesion\", \"band\": 7.0, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"co-ed schools provide better preparation in life for kids\", \"single-sex schools provide a comfortable and relaxed learning environment\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"when a diverse group of people to connect with would help immensely in this process\", \"type\": \"sentence structure\", \"fix\": \"when a diverse group of people to connect with helps immensely in this process\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Ensure that all sentences are complete and grammatically correct to enhance clarity.\", \"Use more cohesive devices, such as 'however' or 'furthermore', to better connect contrasting ideas.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Lexical Resource\", \"band\": 7.0, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"co-ed schools provide better preparation in life for kids\", \"emotional intelligence is mainly cultivated through a person's school years\", \"single-sex schools provide a comfortable and relaxed learning environment\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"the other sex often\", \"type\": \"word choice\", \"fix\": \"the opposite sex frequently\"}, {\"span\": \"unique to each sex\", \"type\": \"word choice\", \"fix\": \"unique to each gender\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Incorporate more varied vocabulary to avoid repetition, such as using synonyms for 'schools' or 'education'.\", \"Use more complex sentence structures to demonstrate a higher level of lexical sophistication.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Grammatical Range & Accuracy\", \"band\": 8.0, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"co-ed schools provide better preparation in life for kids.\", \"It has been shown by Yale that emotional intelligence is mainly cultivated through a person's school years.\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"when a diverse group of people to connect with would help immensely in this process.\", \"type\": \"sentence structure\", \"fix\": \"when a diverse group of people to connect with helps immensely in this process.\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Vary sentence structures further by incorporating more complex sentences.\", \"Ensure subject-verb agreement is maintained throughout the essay.\"]}], \"overall\": 7.5, \"votes\": [7.5, 7.5, 7.5], \"dispersion\": 0.0, \"confidence\": \"high\", \"meta\": {\"prompt_hash\": \"training_data\", \"model\": \"training\", \"schema_version\": \"v1\", \"rubric_version\": \"rubric/v1\", \"token_usage\": {\"input_tokens\": 366, \"output_tokens\": 500}}}"}]}

Many of them failed to get their desired Job and eventually they changed their field. There are many reasons for it which I will discuss in this essay.\r\n\r\nFirstly, there is a saturation of graduates in the same field and the corresponding jobs are limited. For example, every year almost 2000 chemical engineers are graduated from all the Universities in Pakistan but there are only 500 jobs available for them so what will they do in this situation? Unfortunately, they changed their profession because they do not want to waste one year. However, these kinds of problems exist in almost every country who are producing thousands of graduates with limited job opportunities. According to Higher Education Commission, almost every year 50-70% of graduates changed their profession due to not finding the desired job in their career.\r\n\r\nIn addition, before selecting the course, students should research very well the scope and saturation of all desired fields. It will not only help them to get a job in their chosen career but also make them morally strong.

While some argue that people are naturally born as leaders, others contend that these skills can be learned later in life. I strongly believe that the skills for being leadership are inborn, and can be trained over time.\r\n\r\nTo begin with, people claim that leadership is not something that can be achieved. To expand the idea, while considering leaders as people who exert a great influence on people, their powerful presence can not be developed. Being articulate, and having oratory skills, which are supported by several scientists that they are inborn, to influence people through words is essential for being a leader. Furthermore, it is unavoidable that some people are born with a charismatic personality, which is a requirement for leadership. To cite an example, Mozart was a well-known composer in the world, and he composed music at the age of five. This exemplifies that inborn abilities are on a factual basis.\r\n\r\nRegarding the view of the opposite side, there are many affirmations by people who advocate that everyone can be a leader for the rest of their time. What is more, the more effort we put in, the more we practise skills, the better we become. While taking life experience as a significant factor into account, assertiveness to stand up for what you believe in and having confidence can be learned through practice and training. For instance, Bill Gates was a computer scientist 30 years ago, but if we look at the current situation, he is a renowned leader and owner of Microsoft, which emphasises the possibility of learning anything through time. I firmly opine that skills that are related to leadership can be achieved by people as success results from determination and hard work in any field.\r\n\r\nTo conclude, although many believe that people are born with desperate character, the importance of industriousness and practices can not be disregarded. Consequently, I am on the side of people who believe in the power of learning without respite.\n\nProvide your assessment in the specified JSON format."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"per_criterion\": [{\"name\": \"Task Response\", \"band\": 8.0, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"I strongly believe that the skills for being leadership are inborn, and can be trained over time.\", \"I firmly opine that skills that are related to leadership can be achieved by people as success results from determination and hard work in any field.\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"the skills for being leadership are inborn\", \"type\": \"word choice\", \"fix\": \"the skills for being a leader are inborn\"}, {\"span\": \"the importance of industriousness and practices can not be disregarded\", \"type\": \"word choice\", \"fix\": \"the importance of industriousness and practice cannot be disregarded\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Clarify the definitions of innate and achieved leadership qualities to strengthen the argument.\", \"Provide more concrete examples or evidence to support claims about inborn leadership qualities.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Coherence & Cohesion\", \"band\": 7.0, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"I strongly believe that the skills for being leadership are inborn, and can be trained over time.\", \"To expand the idea, while considering leaders as people who exert a great influence on people, their powerful presence can not be developed.\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"the skills for being leadership\", \"type\": \"word choice\", \"fix\": \"the skills for being a leader\"}, {\"span\": \"the importance of industriousness and practices can not be disregarded\", \"type\": \"word choice\", \"fix\": \"the importance of industriousness and practice cannot be disregarded\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Use more varied linking words and phrases to enhance the flow between ideas.\", \"Ensure consistent use of singular and plural forms to avoid confusion.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Lexical Resource\", \"band\": 7.0, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"the skills for being leadership are inborn\", \"which is a requirement for leadership\", \"the power of learning without respite\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"the skills for being leadership\", \"type\": \"word choice\", \"fix\": \"the skills for being a leader\"}, {\"span\": \"can not be developed\", \"type\": \"spelling\", \"fix\": \"cannot be developed\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Use more varied vocabulary to express ideas, such as synonyms for 'leader' or 'leadership'.\", \"Ensure correct usage of contractions and check for common spelling errors.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Grammatical Range & Accuracy\", \"band\": 8.0, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"the skills for being leadership are inborn, and can be trained over time.\", \"the more effort we put in, the more we practise skills, the better we become.\", \"the importance of industriousness and practices can not be disregarded.\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"the skills for being leadership\", \"type\": \"word choice\", \"fix\": \"the skills for leadership\"}, {\"span\": \"can not be disregarded\", \"type\": \"spelling\", \"fix\": \"cannot be disregarded\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Use more varied sentence structures to enhance complexity.\", \"Ensure consistent use of contractions (e.g., use 'cannot' instead of 'can not').\"]}], \"overall\": 7.5, \"votes\": [7.5, 7.5, 7.5], \"dispersion\": 0.0, \"confidence\": \"high\", \"meta\": {\"prompt_hash\": \"training_data\", \"model\": \"training\", \"schema_version\": \"v1\", \"rubric_version\": \"rubric/v1\", \"token_usage\": {\"input_tokens\": 366, \"output_tokens\": 500}}}"}]}

Discuss both views and give your own opinion.\n\nScore this IELTS Task 2 essay according to the rubric, ensuring alignment with the question:\n\nWhether all of things taught by teachers at school is valuable or not  is a controversial issue. In my opinion, most of knowledge which students acquire in their academic career is beneficial to them.                                                       \r\n\r\nThe argument that many knowledge taught by teachers are useless is plausible. There is no denying that some courses have little practical value. For example, elementary politics and history are two compulsory courses during learning at school, but some  students think  these knowledge are so boring that they do not focus on them. Furthermore , these students are less likely to know how to  apply them. Another evidence to support the argument is that students must learn some basic lessons such as math , foreign language and computer technology. Although these things are important for students' career in the future, students do not need to learn them deeply and systematically.  In other words , it is enough for children to  attain nearly intermediate level in terms of general knowledge. To be specific,  there is no need that most of students learn calcus, liner algebra in the university.\r\n\r\nHowever, some people think that  all kinds of things learning at school are valuable. This statement is right to some extent. Firstly, the school is a place where people get necessary knowledge qualified for their jobs. If a person want to be a entrepreneur , he need to take a MBA program or something relevant to management and corporate finance. Secondly, students can be moral and distinguish right from wrong through some  relevant compulsory courses. It is obvious that this statement exaggerate the fact. Not anything learned at school  can students benefit from.                                         \r\n\r\n In conclusion, people can learn ethics and necessary skills for work when they are students.

However, as time is changing so many changes in almost every field can be seen. These days, It is believed that in various nations communities are busy performing their official tasks. There are certain factors responsible for it. This essay will shed light on the reasons and discuss whether it is a beneficial or harmful development in the following paragraphs.\r\n\r\nThere are some factors associated with this issue. The first point of prime importance is financial needs which makes them work the whole day like a machine in order to meet their fundamental household needs. For instance, In countries like India, Inflation is sky-rocketing due to which prices of almost each and every commodity are increasing. Due to this, a huge amount of money is needed to survive in this competitive era. This caused myriad workers to do overtime to earn more.\r\n\r\nAnother major cause is the overloading of tasks. It is clearly visible in corporate sectors as well as in other jobs that employees are facing stress because of enormous duties. In Addition to it, targets given by the employers are needed to be completed in time. Therefore, to accomplish their target they spent long hours on office premises in order to attain that target on time.\r\n\r\nSome considered this change a positive while others think it is  a negative development. According to my point of view, This affects the health of the working population.

Robotics is now a field that is not unknown and the spike, we are seeing in its implementation is something huge. Today, robots are present everywhere whether it is at home as your cleaner and vacuum or in the operation theatre as surgeons' assistants. However, the opinions on it are quite the opposite. Some believe that it is the best invention in the history of mankind while some believe otherwise. I opine that its benefits are weighed higher on the scale as compared to its drawbacks\r\n\r\nTo begin with, robots have taken the world by storm through the outcome and  their performance. The first and foremost advantage is it has never been so easy to solve complex problems as it is today. robots have the innate ability to do various tasks together and to provide accurate answers. Secondly, they are now sharing the workload of human beings by performing various levels of  work thus providing them with  a sense of relaxation. For instance, many surgeries are now performed by Da Vinci which is a specialized robot to assist surgeons and in this way, half of the burden has been reduced.\r\n\r\nOn the other side, there are drawbacks that should be taken into consideration. One of them is the industry will soon be converted into an AI-driven workforce and as a ,result millions of people will be jobless as e!employers will prefer this one-time investment instead of paying an amount every month to the employee. Another thing that is alarming is the lack of power to change decisions timely. These electronics work on the installed and manufactured intelligence therefore they do not have the capability to switch their mode according to circumstances. For example, if a robot is teaching a class that is not disciplined, it has no power to process how to keep children motivated.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, I would like to say that in spite of a few deficiencies, it is going to help human beings in great ways in the near future .

To elaborate, nowadays, people tend to get tired very easily, owing to their monotonous lifestyles.

Visiting these places helps people to broaden their horizon and enhance their knowledge about their ancestral roots. According to an article published in \"THE TIMES\", the students who explored these sites as their history assignment, achieved more success than other students in their exams. Besides this, feeling proud about their identity is an another possible reason. Because of the globalisation the world has become a smaller place, these places serves as a medium to connect people to their traditional roots,and also develop a social bond between them. As a result, they are proud of their national identities and its values.\r\n\r\nTo conclude, while there are valid arguments on both sides, I believe museums have an equally important role to serve as a leisure activity as well as for education, and people have sole right to decide upon what they want to do.\n\nProvide your assessment in the specified JSON format."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"per_criterion\": [{\"name\": \"Task Response\", \"band\": 6.5, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"these galleries serve people in getting rid of their boredom\", \"these museums are the symbol of our cultural history, identity, and traditions\", \"I believe museums have an equally important role to serve as a leisure activity as well as for education\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"as a one of the many options\", \"type\": \"grammatical error\", \"fix\": \"change to 'as one of the many options'\"}, {\"span\": \"an another possible reason\", \"type\": \"grammatical error\", \"fix\": \"change to 'another possible reason'\"}, {\"span\": \"these places serves as a medium\", \"type\": \"subject-verb agreement error\", \"fix\": \"change 'serves' to 'serve'\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Provide more specific examples of how museums educate visitors to strengthen the argument.\", \"Clarify the conclusion by summarizing the main points discussed in the essay.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Coherence & Cohesion\", \"band\": 5.5, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"these galleries serve people in getting rid of their boredom\", \"these museums are the symbol of our cultural history, identity, and traditions\", \"while there are valid arguments on both sides, I believe museums have an equally important role to serve as a leisure activity as well as for education\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"these places serves as a medium to connect people to their traditional roots,and also develop a social bond between them\", \"type\": \"subject-verb agreement\", \"fix\": \"change 'serves' to 'serve' to match the plural subject 'places'\"}, {\"span\": \"an another possible reason\", \"type\": \"redundancy\", \"fix\": \"change 'an another' to 'another'\"}, {\"span\": \"Because of the globalisation the world has become a smaller place\", \"type\": \"punctuation error\", \"fix\": \"add a comma after 'globalisation'\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Use more linking words and phrases to improve the flow between sentences and paragraphs.\", \"Ensure subject-verb agreement is maintained throughout the essay.\", \"Avoid redundancy by using precise language to convey ideas more clearly.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Lexical Resource\", \"band\": 5.5, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"these galleries serve people in getting rid of their boredom\", \"broaden their horizon and enhance their knowledge about their ancestral roots\", \"these places serves as a medium to connect people to their traditional roots\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"these places serves\", \"type\": \"subject-verb agreement\", \"fix\": \"these places serve\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Use a wider range of vocabulary to express ideas more precisely and avoid repetition.\", \"Pay attention to subject-verb agreement to improve grammatical accuracy.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Grammatical Range & Accuracy\", \"band\": 6.5, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"these galleries serve people in getting rid of their boredom.\", \"Visiting these places helps people to broaden their horizon and enhance their knowledge about their ancestral roots.\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"a one of the many options\", \"type\": \"article usage\", \"fix\": \"one of the many options\"}, {\"span\": \"an another possible reason\", \"type\": \"article usage\", \"fix\": \"another possible reason\"}, {\"span\": \"these places serves as a medium\", \"type\": \"subject-verb agreement\", \"fix\": \"these places serve as a medium\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Ensure correct article usage by avoiding unnecessary articles before nouns.\", \"Pay attention to subject-verb agreement, especially with plural subjects.\", \"Vary sentence structures to enhance grammatical range, such as using more complex sentences.\"]}], \"overall\": 6.0, \"votes\": [6.0, 6.0, 6.0], \"dispersion\": 0.0, \"confidence\": \"high\", \"meta\": {\"prompt_hash\": \"training_data\", \"model\": \"training\", \"schema_version\": \"v1\", \"rubric_version\": \"rubric/v1\", \"token_usage\": {\"input_tokens\": 304, \"output_tokens\": 500}}}"}]}

Furthermore, many chinese researchers study a paper showing that it linked to almost a million stillbirths in pregnant women.\r\n\r\nConsequently, these toxic gases are too grave a concern to be tackled by a handful of the citizen and the government. The government should play an important role in a public campaign for reducing a combustion and plastic wastes by making strategies persuading people to be aware of the negative effect unless they keep destroying the environment. For example, the workable solution is promoting the citizen to use the sky train that is the most popular public transports that most salarymen using by reducing fare.

Therefore, public authorities should regulate the consumption of eatables thinking some folks while other opposes that humans should not be limited for the same. Analysing that I opine, the ministry needs to make laws in order to create a barrier for obesity and health problems that are being faced by humans globally.\n\nOn the one hand, more and more population is becoming obese as junk food is the major meal of the day. In America, almost 60 per cent of the citizens rely upon burgers and pizzas for their daily consumption as it is readily available and tasty in comparison to other eatables. Clearly, such sort of health concerns is alarming to the law because citizens are being careless by choosing unhealthy preferences. Thus, it needs to regulate strict laws like banning fast-food chains in order to create awareness among residents.\n\nOn the other hand, it is a basic right of the public to consume as per their taste buds. Consequently, government has no role to play in this case yet society should be clearly responsible for the products they eat. From some stats, it led to a big fight when some people protested to close the pizza stores all over the country.

What's your opinion about it.\n\nScore this IELTS Task 2 essay according to the rubric, ensuring alignment with the question:\n\nThe physical and genetic differences between men and women equip them for different activities and skills. However, in today's, scenario it has been seen that women are proving their mettle even in traditionally male-dominated jobs. This essay shall delve into the reasons for this change.\r\n\r\nThe first and foremost reason is the opportunity today's women are getting. Nowadays, as more and more women in different countries have started working outside the home, it is clear that they are able to perform jobs that were traditionally only held by men. Secondly, today's woman is also going for higher education and because of this, even the highest positions in science, politics or law, for example, can be held successfully by women.\r\n\r\nAnother reason is that today anyone can be trained to do any type of job. There is also increasing scientific evidence that individual differences between people may be more important than gender differences. In other words, women may be physically stronger than some men, while some male individuals may be more sensitive, or more caring than some women.\r\n\r\nI believe that today societies are becoming more egalitarian. Earlier, women worked in the homes in most cultures. The girl child was even denied education in many places. Even if there were employed women, they tended to dominate the so-called caring professions such as teaching, nursing or social work. But today, men and women are walking shoulder to shoulder in every field and the line of demarcation between them has faded.\r\n\r\nTo sum up, in the modern world individual men and women can be trained to develop similar abilities.

To what extent do you agree or disagree?\n\nScore this IELTS Task 2 essay according to the rubric, ensuring alignment with the question:\n\nAdvertising and its influences have long been a topic of numerous debates, especially in recent years. In this regard, some people argue that the impact of advertisements on shoppers is neglectable. However, in contrast, the majority number of people including me hold the view that advertisements could channel the shoppers' choices in an effective way. In the forthcoming paragraphs, I will support this point of view with likely explanations.\r\n\r\nTo begin with, it is widely accepted that the modern human is leading a consumerism lifestyle due to indulging in social media platforms and being bombarded with commercials offering an excessive range of products. This means that huge enterprises meticulously target individuals, particularly younger consumers, with impressive adverts on social media platforms such as Instagram and Telegram. As a result, this level of omnipresence of new products with gimmick options makes it inevitable for young people who spend most of their time surfing the internet. The latest statistics in the UK, for instance, have demonstrated that nearly 60% of people who spend a certain time on the internet buy at least one or two items every month under the direct influence of online advertisements. \r\n\r\nFurthermore, the fact advertisements could be functional in terms of making customers aware of various features, options and models of available products in the market. Thanks to the informative form of adverts, people have an opportunity to compare different items they need in terms of prices and features to make the best decision, which would have not been possible otherwise. This trend is quite beneficial for both individuals and companies as it increases sale figures and boost the economy in society. Apart from that, driven by advertisements, the time devoted to shopping sprees has diminished substantially due to the fact that before attending the malls or shops people exactly know which items and brands they want to purchase. For example, when I have to buy a mobile phone I  do not waste my time in the shop since, thanks to the adverts and pops on the Internet, I am already familiar with the exact features, costs and quality of every available smartphone in the market which makes the process of buying in the shop significantly lower.\r\n\r\nTo sum up, despite the fact that a minority group of people do not trust adverts anyway, in my opinion, most people, especially younger ones are affected by advertisements since not only it could enhance their knowledge about different goods but also  can stimulate demand

How can people research this?\n\nScore this IELTS Task 2 essay according to the rubric, ensuring alignment with the question:\n\nThe increasing number of people across countries want to trace the history of the places they settle in. There are quite several reasons for such a phenomenon.\r\n\r\nFor the first reason, human has a tendency to look back to the past to further know about the origins of objectives around them and, sometimes, to find a sense of connection. Furthermore, with concrete residential buildings almost everywhere, we can hardly spot a major difference that makes people feel something special about such places. However, once they figure out what stood there instead of the current massive modern infrastructure and who lived in it, for instance, a close bond and involvement may be fostered.\r\n\r\n Secondly, it would be something people do out of curiosity. Some people even opine that once discovering something prestigious about the past of such a location, its explicitly growing reputation would make it more worth living. Such motivation urges people to contribute more to society to meet their inner pride. Since the world is constantly changing, it is more likely that people can not feasibly find out, for example, when something was exactly built and what the incentives behind such structures were, that is why it is also a challenging mission.\r\n\r\nThere are aquite several ways to have the answer regarding appropriate methodology. Firstly, the most well-known tool for general scientific research, the Internet could lead you to some case studies and then you have to assess whether those are authentically censored information provided by Google or posted by a random unidentified information supplier. Moreover, it is quite rare that you are the only person who exists and cares for a specific subject that never crossed others' minds. Secondly, the elderly near you may know something. Since many of them have lived in the same place in their entire lifetime, they witness how it has been changed. Having daily conversations with them may help you uncover meaningful and intriguing facts, not only about any discrete place.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, the incentives behind people’s intention to figure out historical-related information of where they live vary, yet curiosity and desire of having tighter connections may be dominant.

I completely support the viewpoint as it can help in improving literacy rate as well as social life.\r\n\r\nEducation is one of the main pillars of every country, although it is challenging for the under-developed countries to deliver free schooling at the primary level. But If the government initiates  this offer, it can help to reduce poverty by allowing children to learn basic fundamentals, for example, reading newspapers, doing calculations and improving writing skills that are needed on a daily basis. As a result, It not only allows children to survive in society but also their families to learn from them, especially those who come from rural areas. \r\n\r\nAnother reason for offering education at no cost is to raise an individual as an integral part of society to participate in growing its nation.

With the hike in prices, it would not be economical anymore for every person to afford and would lead them to opt for other options. However, other options like electric cars must have the capability to be able to compete and replace the fuel ones. Also, with higher prices, people will switch to judicious use of fuel and will use their personal car whenever it is absolutely necessary. With public transport becoming more popular and affordable, it would reduce our dependency on fuel.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, when equivalent alternates are not available, it would be hard for people to switch. This would force people to buy expensive fuel for their vehicles, resulting in an increase in the price of services they offer, and simultaneously an increase in market inflation, which has its own bad effects. Therefore, in long run, we have to look for energy from renewable sources, such as sun, wind, hydro and nuclear.\r\n\r\nTo sum up the discussion, we find, that hike in prices, will partially serve our purpose in the short term.

People are discussing  the climate change more often than ever. Currently, the earth temperature is increasing by more than 3 degrees on an annual basis due to shifts in weather. To keep a check on this rapid temperature change, governments and organisations across the globe are putting in cummulative efforts. While this change has brought a concern to authorities, it has proven to be advantageous for many corporates in many business aspects.\r\n\r\nFirst and foremost,  this climate change has added an extra burden on the finances of many global companies. Many corporates have been increasing their amount of Corporate Social Responsibility(CSR) towards this climate change. For instance, in recent report by Financial Times, companies have increased their CSR index amount to an average of 3%, which was earlier 1%. Furthermore, this change has clearly disrupted the demand-supply chain for companies. As more and more people are concerned about the environment, they are shifting towards the usage of eco-friendly products. People are avoiding buying new automobiles, Air conditioners, Refrigerators nowadays and this is, in turn, has increased the supply more than its demand, which creates a loss for many companies. Clearly, climate change has shown a detrimental effect on many businesses.\r\n\r\nHowever, this adjustment has provided ample opportunities for many start-ups. Many communities are actively contributing to the cause to heal the planet. Many new start-ups have started businesses like manufacturing paper bags, cloth bags etc. These companies, by setting up the factories in rural areas, have created numerous job employment and hence, contributing towards the economy of the nation. Therefore, for many new but small corporates, this climate change is the best bet to save the planet and increase their business turnover.\r\n\r\nTo conclude,  climate transition has abrupted many businesses but has created  awareness among people to save  mankind.

To what extent do you agree or disagree?\n\nScore this IELTS Task 2 essay according to the rubric, ensuring alignment with the question:\n\nIndeed, most people use vehicles that require fuel to work. Nowadays, increasing fuel costs wouldn't be adequate to solve environmental issues since the community would continue using primary and faster transport. In addition, other reasons are included for the ecological unbalance, such as the deforest, Agropecuario, humans, etc. Thus, I strongly disagree with this trying solution.\r\n\r\nFirst of all, the car's engines have been changed to hybrid and electric cars, which helps solve some of the issues. Said that, would be a good action by the factors to reduce the price of these types of vehicles. Additionally, more encouragement through some Public Policies made by the government and businesses with multimedia marketing to society starting to ride bikes, take the bus, or walk to their destinations instead of using the car. Second, a clear example that increasing fuel prices may not work is represented by the war between Russia and Ukraine, where the public continued filling their gas transport; instead, they only complained about the high costs.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, the high demand for meat, eggs, and dairy products humans has been contributing to the increase in deforestation. Thus, with plain land, the farmers or factories can raise more farm animals, like cows, goats, pigs, and chickens. These animals also pollute the land, rivers, and air on a large scale.

In my opinion, they should use social sites to connect with different communities around them, but with caution. Further in my essay, I will pen down a few benefits of using social applications, followed by their disadvantages.\r\n\r\nTo begin with, the primary advantage of using social media is eliminating the communication barrier caused due to distance. Moreover, one can update himself with the latest news that has been trending around the world. Also, getting to know different people globally proves beneficial in exchanging knowledge and different thought process, which assists in widening the perspective. For instance, one of the employment-oriented online services helps connect people with similar interests and gives an insight into various skillsets used across the firms. This can bring like-minded groups closer.\r\n\r\nOn the contrary, the over abuse of social platforms can lead to loss of valuable time, which otherwise could have been used for productive work. Furthermore, lately, the cybercrime rate has increased tremendously in the past few years. For example, recently, a woman was robbed by a fake profile who claimed to be a bank official. Since the practice of such platforms does not come with identity verification, which means there are high chances of confronting fake profiles.\r\n\r\nI believe that the advantages of using social media are more than its disadvantages because it helps exchange knowledge, and the only downside is its uncautious use.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, if used cautiously, social media can help find like-minded people.

It is thought that giving stringent punishments to offenders would reduce accidents. In my opinion, I completely agree with that thought, because people commit mistakes as they are taking things as granted.\r\n\r\nFirstly, most of the accidents are happening because of negligence while driving. Particulary, in the developing countries, people does not obey the traffic rules as there are not much strict punishments for disobeying driving rules. Unlike developed countries, where they have technologies in place to identify persons breaking the traffic laws. For example, many advanced economic countires have AI based camera at signals to capture photographs of cars that violates red signal and they would be punished at later point with the evidence captured. However, to implement these technologies in developing and under developing countires would be a huge problem as it inccur massive costs.\r\n\r\nSecondly, this is all about people mindset. For example, many countires have high degree of punishments for serious crimes and people will not dare to commit those crimes. Whereas, when it comes to driving offenses, it is not taken so seriously and also the penalty charges imposed are also very low. Hence, people will not take these laws very seriously. On the other hand, creating awareness by including traffic/driving laws in school subjects and campaign the effects of breaking laws would help but thats for the longer term as it would take time to see the results.\r\n\r\nFinally, in my opinion, relatively harsh punishments and more fines are required to bring down the driving offenses so that people take these laws more seriously and adopt it.

While others think it affects learning.  \r\nDiscuss both viewpoints and give your opinion by giving relevant reasons and examples.\n\nScore this IELTS Task 2 essay according to the rubric, ensuring alignment with the question:\n\nMany people think that students have to opt for a year for something other than study, after school and before joining the university. Meanwhile, many believe that it would disturb their learning. According to me, it is better to have one year spare to excel in some skills other than studies. Further, the essay will explain my viewpoint.\r\n\r\nTo begin with, I would say, it must be added to the curriculum to practice one year for other vocational learning. This means anyone can get a chance to learn the skill, that would help him further in his hard times. For instance, I personally experience the same, after completing my schooling, I  spent six months learning the basics of stitching clothes, as that thing helped me a lot  throughout my life. As, I have saved my money in terms of the stitching fee of tailors, which are too  demanding these days. Moreover, there is so much vocational training in different fields which can be beneficial for both males and females. \r\n\r\nOn the other hand, it may be possible that, if a pupil takes a break after schooling in any circumstance, there are chances that he may indulge in unhealthy activities. That may damage their personalities in the long run. For example, adults can be distracted by the bad company of friends. They may become  prone to mobile or social media, or towards other divergences if there is no assignment for them. Furthermore, one significant drawback is, the discipline which they have learnt in school would be in danger, as, they tend to be lazy and inactive.\r\n\r\nTo conclude, few individuals think it is preferable to take a break from studying after finishing  school while others have a different opinion. Pupils can get vocational learning at this time, but there are chances that they would harm their behaviour due to bad company or less beneficial activities. \r\n\r\n In my view, there must be a gap of twelve months to learn any skill that earns in difficulties.\n\nProvide your assessment in the specified JSON format."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"per_criterion\": [{\"name\": \"Task Response\", \"band\": 7.5, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"it is better to have one year spare to excel in some skills other than studies.\", \"there is so much vocational training in different fields which can be beneficial for both males and females.\", \"Pupils can get vocational learning at this time, but there are chances that they would harm their behaviour due to bad company or less beneficial activities.\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"it must be added to the curriculum to practice one year for other vocational learning.\", \"type\": \"clarity\", \"fix\": \"Rephrase to clarify that the year should be included in the educational system for vocational learning.\"}, {\"span\": \"there must be a gap of twelve months to learn any skill that earns in difficulties.\", \"type\": \"clarity\", \"fix\": \"Rephrase to clarify the intended meaning, possibly by stating 'to learn any skill that can help in difficult times.'\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Provide more specific examples of vocational skills that could be learned during the gap year.\", \"Clarify the potential negative impacts of taking a gap year to strengthen the argument.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Coherence & Cohesion\", \"band\": 6.5, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"it is better to have one year spare to excel in some skills other than studies\", \"there are chances that they would harm their behaviour due to bad company or less beneficial activities\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"it must be added to the curriculum to practice one year for other vocational learning\", \"type\": \"clarity\", \"fix\": \"Rephrase to clarify that the year should be dedicated to vocational learning, rather than being added to the curriculum.\"}, {\"span\": \"the discipline which they have learnt in school would be in danger, as, they tend to be lazy and inactive\", \"type\": \"punctuation\", \"fix\": \"Remove the comma after 'as' for correct punctuation.\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Use clearer transitions between ideas to enhance the flow of the essay.\", \"Avoid ambiguous phrases like 'that thing helped me a lot' by specifying how it helped.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Lexical Resource\", \"band\": 6.5, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"it is better to have one year spare to excel in some skills other than studies\", \"there is so much vocational training in different fields which can be beneficial for both males and females\", \"there must be a gap of twelve months to learn any skill that earns in difficulties\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"that would help him further in his hard times\", \"type\": \"word choice\", \"fix\": \"that would help him in difficult times\"}, {\"span\": \"the discipline which they have learnt in school would be in danger\", \"type\": \"word choice\", \"fix\": \"the discipline they have learned in school would be at risk\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Use a wider range of vocabulary to express ideas more precisely and avoid repetition.\", \"Consider using more formal language and avoiding colloquial expressions to enhance the academic tone of the essay.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Grammatical Range & Accuracy\", \"band\": 7.5, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"it must be added to the curriculum to practice one year for other vocational learning.\", \"there are chances that he may indulge in unhealthy activities.\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"that would help him further in his hard times\", \"type\": \"subject-verb agreement\", \"fix\": \"that would help them further in their hard times\"}, {\"span\": \"the discipline which they have learnt in school would be in danger, as, they tend to be lazy and inactive\", \"type\": \"punctuation error\", \"fix\": \"the discipline which they have learnt in school would be in danger as they tend to be lazy and inactive\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Use gender-neutral language to enhance inclusivity, such as using 'they' instead of 'he' when referring to a pupil.\", \"Avoid unnecessary commas that disrupt the flow of sentences, especially before conjunctions.\"]}], \"overall\": 7.0, \"votes\": [7.0, 7.0, 7.0], \"dispersion\": 0.0, \"confidence\": \"high\", \"meta\": {\"prompt_hash\": \"training_data\", \"model\": \"training\", \"schema_version\": \"v1\", \"rubric_version\": \"rubric/v1\", \"token_usage\": {\"input_tokens\": 373, \"output_tokens\": 500}}}"}]}

This is a major concern for governments as it not only increase the cost of living, but also affects the quality of life for its residents. I do agree that only governments can solve this problem by taking various measures, such as restricting landed houses to save the space, encouraging vertical residential buildings and gradually expanding the city.\n\nIn the olden days, people lived in landed independent houses as there were lots of spaces in the city. However, this is not possible in the modern cities as the city population is increasing rapidly, and resulting in a space shortage situation for accommodating housing for all. One of the action governments can take is to discourage building new landed houses and encourage people to live in apartment flats. For instance, the Singapore government has built thousands of high-floor residential flats through a housing development board to accommodate its ever-growing residents in an affordable way. It also stopped permitting for building new landed houses to deal with the space crunch.\n\nSome governments are also looking at options for expanding the city to create more residential properties. For example, Bangalore, one of the fast growing cities in India is continuously expanding by incorporating more residential properties and other infrastructure at the outskirts of the city, which gradually becomes part of the growing city. However, this option is viable only when there are enough spaces surrounding the city. For cities like Hong-Kong and Singapore, which are islands, the only option is to grow vertically within the city. Solving the housing shortage is an issue that requires proper planning and big investment and residence of a big city have very little to do and the government seems like the appropriate authority to solve this problem.  \n\nIn conclusion, the cities are growing rapidly and so the residents of the city also grow.

Some people think this is a good idea, while others disagree. \r\n\r\nDiscuss both views and give your opinion.\n\nScore this IELTS Task 2 essay according to the rubric, ensuring alignment with the question:\n\nThere is a debate over whether the personal possession of a gun should be justifiable or not. Both views will be discussed in this essay and I believe that the latter view is more persuasive.\r\n\r\nTo begin with, there are some reasons why people can legitimately possess a gun. For one thing, people can protect themselves with a gun, especially when they are in a hazardous situation. There might be a moment where public power, such as police, is vacant. For example, if they are threatened by robberies, they can use their gun so as to immediately escape the danger.\r\n\r\nIn spite of the reasons mentioned above, I reckon that private guns should be illegal. This is because, firstly, it leads to unsafe surroundings, causing abuse of the gun. To be specific, it would give rise to not only serious injuries but also jeopardy of life provided that someone accidentally shoots others. In fact, there are a lot of random shooting accidents in  countries where the government grants to carry a gun, case in point, USA.

Although reducing poverty depends on some factors; I totally agree with the statement that improvement is far more beneficial for individuals' advancement and economic growth. \r\n\r\nTo begin with, allocating the state budget for learning is fundamental for personal expansion in that nation. In fact, investing in discipline for the young such as providing voluntarily six-year schooling helps them easily access  basic knowledge (reading, writing and using numbers skills) creating a foundation in order to achieve higher education. Take, for example, A study by the World Bank found that children who attend school for at least 12 years are more likely to be employed, earn higher wages, and have better health outcomes than those who do not attend school. \r\n\r\nFurthermore, there are several factors to decrease  poverty in developing countries; however, providing free education is far more beneficial for long-term economic growth. Generally, having well-educated and skilled workers can result in increasing the average income of individuals, which contributes to higher tax revenues. For illustrate,  Finland, a country that offers free schooling from preschool to university, boasts one of the world's highest levels of teaching and standards of living, with its highly skilled and productive workforce playing a key role in maintaining its robust economy.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, it is undoubted that investment in pedagogy plays a vital role in the success of countries.

Almost everyone has a car and do not like to use public transportation because it is difficult to go to work by bus or metro especially from the suburbs. However, if the government raises the price of petrol and make their public transportation systems more enticing, it will make citizens more likely to utilize it.\r\n\r\nThere are multiple methods that the government could implement to persuade people to make more use of public transport and stop using their own cars. For example, if people can get a discount for taking public transportation, they will be willing to do it from time to time. The government could also implement and build infrastructure and systems for people to ride their bicycles. If it is convenient for everyone to rent bikes from one place and return to another, it will become more popular for people to use it and will reduce the amount of time they spend driving their cars which will have a positive effect on the environment.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, it is not only because of people driving cars and the resultant carbon dioxide emissions that the human-race is having a negative impact on the environment, there are a plethora of other factors which are also contributing to this impact.

Personally, I strongly advocate this view. In this essay, I will discuss the reason why I think this trend would be helpful with some examples.  \r\n\r\nPractical education should be more emphasized because whatever they learn through the practical way that knowledge will remain with them for a longer period. This ultimately increases the effectiveness of learning.  For instance, When we are cramming a lesson for a test, our brain tends to remember it for a short while, which can be shorter than the duration of your test thus not serving the original purpose. While doing it practically, it can be in form of experiments, real-life projects, or educational trips, the knowledge and the whole learning experience stays in our mind for a long. So apart from bookish knowledge, practical education is very important for students. \r\n\r\nMoreover, practical education through vocational training boosts a student’s self-esteem, knowledge, and skills, and enhances their transition into working life. With the competition for jobs increasing, employers are now seeking to hire candidates who can demonstrate their skills rather than reeling off a list of theoretical qualifications. ‘Earn a university degree and get a job’, this formula has worked over many decades, but increasingly many fields today the formula is no longer working. For example, people who have maintained a good degree of computer literacy, especially coding a skill which cannot be obtained by conventional education, are very welcome in the job market. \r\n\r\nTo conclude, it is clear that the benefits of practical learning outweigh the disadvantages, by providing more employment to people and enhancing the effectiveness of learning.

In the opinion of experts from both developed and developing countries, instead of finding a solution to rectify the drastic climate change, we should deem new methods of living with this substantial condition. According to my verdict, the idea of not untangling the extreme climatic change is completely preposterous, but for short term trying to accommodate is not entirely wrong.\nFirstly, unraveling the climate condition caused abundant money and handful of resources, which could be unendurable for developing countries. Moreover, rectifying the environmental issues that caused climate change could be very time-consuming and hectic. Although human survival is directly dependent on climate condition, various life threatening issues are also existed which demand hotfoot solution. For example, the contagious and life threatening disease corona virus needs more attention to make the vaccine and be curable. Because of this disease the death rate is 56%, and it is very alarmingly  high than death rate due to climate changes.\nVerily, there are other serious issues that need urgent solution, but the idea of not taking measures to control climate hazards is completely outrageous. Extreme climate change not only dangerous for human survival, but also for animals and other natural habitat. For instance, the Forest fires in Australia and many other regions which disturb the natural ecosystem of many animals, are the result of extreme climate changes. Legislation and serious measures should be done by government to prevent and rectify drastic climate changes. Furthermore, climate problem leads to many severe problems like water depletion, shortage of natural resources, and environmental pollution.\nTo conclude, the idea of not preventing extreme climate
