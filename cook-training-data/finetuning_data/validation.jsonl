Other people argue that everything that children study at school is useful at sometime. \n\nDiscuss the both views and give your opinion.\n\nScore this IELTS Task 2 essay according to the rubric, ensuring alignment with the question:\n\nCertain people support the idea that some things that children are taught at school are useless, while other individuals believe that everything learned could be useful at some point. Although the complaints of the first group are understandable, in fact, children always benefit at least from the learning processes involved. And while I would like to see more practical lessons being taught, I support the idea that everything learned could be useful in some aspect.\r\n\r\nIt would be very good to see young students making good and practical use of most things learned at school. Many people could relate to some of the complaints around this topic because even when we look back at our past, we can remember learning many things that were never useful in any practical form. For example, even if you work with mathematics there were formulas that you learned that you probably never used in your whole life, the same applies to every other area of study. As a result, certain people and especially parents, wouldn't be supportive of some classes their children are taking at school.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, most of us do not exactly understand how the processes of learning work. Furthermore, we are not competent to decide whether something could be useful or not, because even when we don't learn something practical, the process of rationalizing and achieving the answer could be important to our brain development. For instance, the logical thinking is constantly used in our lives even without our acknowledgement. In addition, teachers can stimulate the interests of some students when they get involved in certain topics, such as the environment, animal care and protection, health care and many others.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, I like to think that the fact that some things are not exactly practical to the students doesn't mean that they are a waste of time.

Because, it would help him to earn a decent living. It would mean that institution teachers always discipline to kids, which always turn children into effective workers. Moreover, another pivotal aspect of this argument is that juniors go to the institute and they learn lots of new skills as well as observe the knowledge. this is to express, the leaner daily meet new students in academy time. So, easily learn new things. For example, In university life children are learning what is right and wrong for themselves and academy instills the cultural value that are shared the society. Needless to say, all these merits stand in a good stead.\nElaborating my viewpoint, there are some more merits, but one of the crucial effect is that students are able to choose the subjects that best suit them. Therefore, academy education, children able to develop an understanding about the world in which they live. For instance, the tutors are trained to help children understand their strengths and improve their weaknesses.

The question is robots are a replacement for humans in the workspace?  This ,  in this , the essay I'm going to say what I believe in this matter.\r\n\r\nFirstly, there is no way to create a machine that can replicate how the human minds work. Scientists themself fund the human mind as unique and a miracle. However, robots taking jobs are possible. For instance, efforts like customer service, security. Moreover, This work does not require a lot of effort and could be automated because these tasks do not require any skills at all. To illustrate,for  a job like customer service the employee should follow the easy steps. For that, the robot will not face problems that require human interference and it should be automated.\r\n\r\nSecondly, To make a machine work or understand a thing you have to feed it with a huge amount of information. Moreover, it takes years of researching and trying to make a robot do one single job that people takes among others. For example, Scientists from MIT published a paper saying that about machines. Such as, Siri took years to develop and it could not match how humans think or respond and it will take many years to be a good speaker as anybody.\r\n\r\nTo conclude, I don't think that machine is going to take over peoples career.

Idleness is not only bad to an individual but it is also bad to the community. An idle teenager for instance would indulge in bad behaviours like using illicit drugs, prostitution, theft, cyber-crime, alcoholism among others. This would result to a community with people who are dangerous to themselves as well as to other society members. \r\n\r\nMoreover, teenagers acquire knowledge and skills when they volunteer during their leisure time. It is during the community work that teenagers will learn the importance of keeping the environment clean. Some skills like planting of trees will be learnt during the community activities. Ultimately, all the activities done will be beneficial to the community at large.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, involving teenagers in community work during their free time prevents idleness and equips them with knowledge and skills that are beneficial to them as well as to the community.

And they could invest in renewable energy production from solar,wind and water power.

For example, if they are threatened by robberies, they can use their gun so as to immediately escape the danger.\r\n\r\nIn spite of the reasons mentioned above, I reckon that private guns should be illegal.

To be specific, it would give rise to not only serious injuries but also jeopardy of life provided that someone accidentally shoots others. In fact, there are a lot of random shooting accidents in  countries where the government grants to carry a gun, case in point, USA. Furthermore, the probability of a shooting accident is much greater than encountering burglars.

Children who grow near  arms are more likely to be tamed by drastic ways to resolve the problem compared to the other kids who live without  guns.\r\n\r\nIn a nutshell, although some people contend that a gun is needed for self-protection, allowing to keep guns has more demerits of safety and education.\n\nProvide your assessment in the specified JSON format."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"per_criterion\": [{\"name\": \"Task Response\", \"band\": 6.0, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"There is a debate over whether the personal possession of a gun should be justifiable or not\", \"This is because, firstly, it leads to unsafe surroundings, causing abuse of the gun\", \"In a nutshell, although some people contend that a gun is needed for self-protection, allowing to keep guns has more demerits of safety and education\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"There is a debate over whether the personal possession of a gun should be justifiable or not\", \"type\": \"task\", \"fix\": \"Consider improving the task response aspect here.\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Develop your main arguments more fully with specific examples.\", \"Ensure you address all parts of the question directly.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Coherence & Cohesion\", \"band\": 5.0, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"There is a debate over whether the personal possession of a gun should be justifiable or not\", \"This is because, firstly, it leads to unsafe surroundings, causing abuse of the gun\", \"In a nutshell, although some people contend that a gun is needed for self-protection, allowing to keep guns has more demerits of safety and education\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"There is a debate over whether the personal possession of a gun should be justifiable or not\", \"type\": \"coherence\", \"fix\": \"Consider improving the coherence & cohesion aspect here.\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Use more varied linking words to connect your ideas.\", \"Improve paragraph structure with clearer topic sentences.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Lexical Resource\", \"band\": 5.0, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"There is a debate over whether the personal possession of a gun should be justifiable or not\", \"This is because, firstly, it leads to unsafe surroundings, causing abuse of the gun\", \"In a nutshell, although some people contend that a gun is needed for self-protection, allowing to keep guns has more demerits of safety and education\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"There is a debate over whether the personal possession of a gun should be justifiable or not\", \"type\": \"lexical\", \"fix\": \"Consider improving the lexical resource aspect here.\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Use more sophisticated vocabulary and avoid repetition.\", \"Focus on precise word choice and natural collocations.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Grammatical Range & Accuracy\", \"band\": 6.0, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"There is a debate over whether the personal possession of a gun should be justifiable or not\", \"This is because, firstly, it leads to unsafe surroundings, causing abuse of the gun\", \"In a nutshell, although some people contend that a gun is needed for self-protection, allowing to keep guns has more demerits of safety and education\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"There is a debate over whether the personal possession of a gun should be justifiable or not\", \"type\": \"grammar\", \"fix\": \"Consider improving the grammatical range & accuracy aspect here.\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Use more complex sentence structures.\", \"Check for grammatical errors and improve accuracy.\"]}], \"overall\": 5.5}"}]}

It is surely a reliable reference for them to decide whether to continue to live there or to move to another place. Besides that, those who had no choice of changing location, probably have a plan to prevent such threatening issues. In addition, researching the history of the building, which means thoroughly understanding the building age, the original structure, and the purpose used by the previous owners, is to answer their concerns about its quality and sustainability. For instance, a house or a building that was constructed over 10 years ago with traditional design and has suffered from many different objectives of the other landlords, cannot ensure its long duration of use.\r\n\r\nThere are several ways to learn about its history. Firstly, it is quite easy to access and search the information such as the previous owners and what the building had been used for via the Internet. Moreover, by visiting and asking neighbors who have lived there for a long period, residents may collect tons of news, especially some rumors and thrilling stories that probably are not published to society. Someone even asks the retail agency and government officers directly for more details.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, in some countries, inhabitants these days are more excited to learn about the stories of the place they live in, for various reasons including their safety and their houses’ life expectancy.

In other words, when the garbage collector comes in the street to pick the waste material they go to the cabinet store to through all these waste products and then they and then they do fire on it after that pollution is create around the areas. Thus, this occur the problem of disease and asthma attack. Secondly, the main point is that less opportunities of job available in the factory. It means, if customers do not comes in the factory or shop to buy the garments so the owner of the factory will loss their sales in daily routine. Moreoso, if new fresher comes to the shop for job vacancy and the manager of the shop says their is no available and also they give a less salary to employees who working in the shop.\n\nOn the other hand, there are some Of the Tribble to solve this matter. To explain it, government should take high funds from the people and also provid some awareness and campaigned programs among society persons. In other words, there should be hight panelty to consumer goods who are doing these things. \n\nTo recapitulate, although I would like to despite in the fact that there some of the cause which can be followed by the people;however, some of the solutions which gives the benifit to the individuals to stop this habit.\n\nProvide your assessment in the specified JSON format."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"per_criterion\": [{\"name\": \"Task Response\", \"band\": 4.5, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"There is no doubt that, the importance of natural environment isvaluable for every people to have in there areas\", \"Thus, this occur the problem of disease and asthma attack\", \"To recapitulate, although I would like to despite in the fact that there some of the cause which can be followed by the people;however, some of the solutions which gives the benifit to the individuals to stop this habit\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"There is no doubt that, the importance of natural environment isvaluable for every people to have in\", \"type\": \"task\", \"fix\": \"Consider improving the task response aspect here.\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Develop your main arguments more fully with specific examples.\", \"Ensure you address all parts of the question directly.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Coherence & Cohesion\", \"band\": 3.5, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"There is no doubt that, the importance of natural environment isvaluable for every people to have in there areas\", \"Thus, this occur the problem of disease and asthma attack\", \"To recapitulate, although I would like to despite in the fact that there some of the cause which can be followed by the people;however, some of the solutions which gives the benifit to the individuals to stop this habit\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"There is no doubt that, the importance of natural environment isvaluable for every people to have in\", \"type\": \"coherence\", \"fix\": \"Consider improving the coherence & cohesion aspect here.\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Use more varied linking words to connect your ideas.\", \"Improve paragraph structure with clearer topic sentences.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Lexical Resource\", \"band\": 3.5, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"There is no doubt that, the importance of natural environment isvaluable for every people to have in there areas\", \"Thus, this occur the problem of disease and asthma attack\", \"To recapitulate, although I would like to despite in the fact that there some of the cause which can be followed by the people;however, some of the solutions which gives the benifit to the individuals to stop this habit\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"There is no doubt that, the importance of natural environment isvaluable for every people to have in\", \"type\": \"lexical\", \"fix\": \"Consider improving the lexical resource aspect here.\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Use more sophisticated vocabulary and avoid repetition.\", \"Focus on precise word choice and natural collocations.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Grammatical Range & Accuracy\", \"band\": 4.5, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"There is no doubt that, the importance of natural environment isvaluable for every people to have in there areas\", \"Thus, this occur the problem of disease and asthma attack\", \"To recapitulate, although I would like to despite in the fact that there some of the cause which can be followed by the people;however, some of the solutions which gives the benifit to the individuals to stop this habit\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"There is no doubt that, the importance of natural environment isvaluable for every people to have in\", \"type\": \"grammar\", \"fix\": \"Consider improving the grammatical range & accuracy aspect here.\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Use more complex sentence structures.\", \"Check for grammatical errors and improve accuracy.\"]}], \"overall\": 4.0}"}]}

Although it can be argued that there is nothing we could do to tackle this issue, I firmly believe some resolutions can proceed from different stakeholders. \r\n\r\nOn the one hand, there are two reasons to argue that it is overdue to undertake the adverse effects of human activities on nature. Firstly, many wildlife habitats have been destroyed due to deforestation for economic purposes. We destroyed enormous rainforest areas and over-exploited natural resources, thus, demolished the nutrients, water, and shelters for animals and plants. As a result, thousands of species are reported lost to human activity. For instance, Western Black Rhino went extinct in 2011. Secondly, despite advanced science and technology, there have been challenges to revive various extinct species so far. The de-extinction programs require billions of investments, not only for genetic technologies but also for habitats conservation.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the collaboration of international and domestic stakeholders can deliver effective resolutions throughout regulation, intervention programs, and financial aids. The government should introduce laws to protect natural areas, such as logging or trophy hunting. These acts will not only conserve wildlife habitats but also deter species from extinction. Moreover, non-governmental organisations like World Wild Fund for Nature have a critical role in environmental protection. Intervention programs collaborated with local authorities can enhance the community's awareness about climate change. Various international funding can help domestic organisations to conduct practical projects against pollution or deforestation. \r\n\r\nIn conclusion, albeit various species have been endangered and lost to human activity, it is better late than never to have intermediate call-to-action from countries to save the planet.\n\nProvide your assessment in the specified JSON format."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"per_criterion\": [{\"name\": \"Task Response\", \"band\": 8.5, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"Human activities have indeed damaged many animals and plants\", \"The de-extinction programs require billions of investments, not only for genetic technologies but also for habitats conservation\", \"In conclusion, albeit various species have been endangered and lost to human activity, it is better late than never to have intermediate call-to-action from countries to save the planet\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"Human activities have indeed damaged many animals and plants\", \"type\": \"task\", \"fix\": \"Consider improving the task response aspect here.\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Develop your main arguments more fully with specific examples.\", \"Ensure you address all parts of the question directly.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Coherence & Cohesion\", \"band\": 7.5, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"Human activities have indeed damaged many animals and plants\", \"The de-extinction programs require billions of investments, not only for genetic technologies but also for habitats conservation\", \"In conclusion, albeit various species have been endangered and lost to human activity, it is better late than never to have intermediate call-to-action from countries to save the planet\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"Human activities have indeed damaged many animals and plants\", \"type\": \"coherence\", \"fix\": \"Consider improving the coherence & cohesion aspect here.\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Use more varied linking words to connect your ideas.\", \"Improve paragraph structure with clearer topic sentences.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Lexical Resource\", \"band\": 7.5, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"Human activities have indeed damaged many animals and plants\", \"The de-extinction programs require billions of investments, not only for genetic technologies but also for habitats conservation\", \"In conclusion, albeit various species have been endangered and lost to human activity, it is better late than never to have intermediate call-to-action from countries to save the planet\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"Human activities have indeed damaged many animals and plants\", \"type\": \"lexical\", \"fix\": \"Consider improving the lexical resource aspect here.\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Use more sophisticated vocabulary and avoid repetition.\", \"Focus on precise word choice and natural collocations.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Grammatical Range & Accuracy\", \"band\": 8.5, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"Human activities have indeed damaged many animals and plants\", \"The de-extinction programs require billions of investments, not only for genetic technologies but also for habitats conservation\", \"In conclusion, albeit various species have been endangered and lost to human activity, it is better late than never to have intermediate call-to-action from countries to save the planet\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"Human activities have indeed damaged many animals and plants\", \"type\": \"grammar\", \"fix\": \"Consider improving the grammatical range & accuracy aspect here.\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Use more complex sentence structures.\", \"Check for grammatical errors and improve accuracy.\"]}], \"overall\": 8.0}"}]}

While some argue that people are naturally born as leaders, others contend that these skills can be learned later in life. I strongly believe that the skills for being leadership are inborn, and can be trained over time.\r\n\r\nTo begin with, people claim that leadership is not something that can be achieved. To expand the idea, while considering leaders as people who exert a great influence on people, their powerful presence can not be developed. Being articulate, and having oratory skills, which are supported by several scientists that they are inborn, to influence people through words is essential for being a leader. Furthermore, it is unavoidable that some people are born with a charismatic personality, which is a requirement for leadership. To cite an example, Mozart was a well-known composer in the world, and he composed music at the age of five. This exemplifies that inborn abilities are on a factual basis.\r\n\r\nRegarding the view of the opposite side, there are many affirmations by people who advocate that everyone can be a leader for the rest of their time. What is more, the more effort we put in, the more we practise skills, the better we become. While taking life experience as a significant factor into account, assertiveness to stand up for what you believe in and having confidence can be learned through practice and training. For instance, Bill Gates was a computer scientist 30 years ago, but if we look at the current situation, he is a renowned leader and owner of Microsoft, which emphasises the possibility of learning anything through time. I firmly opine that skills that are related to leadership can be achieved by people as success results from determination and hard work in any field.\r\n\r\nTo conclude, although many believe that people are born with desperate character, the importance of industriousness and practices can not be disregarded.

Similar goods and products are available all over the world via e-commerce websites and offline markets. In this essay, we will discuss both positive and negative aspects of it.\r\n\r\nTo begin with, international trade has increased exponentially in the last 2 decades due to technological advancement and brand establishments. Big brands like Zara, Gucci and Prada have their presence across the globe. Their stores can be found in almost all the countries. Just like this brand's, there are many other brand's which are available across the globe. Due to globalisation, it has become convenient for buyers to buy products of international brands in their own country. Initially, only people who could afford to travel to different countries were able to buy international products. However, now the scenario has changed and many of this brand's shops are available in almost all the countries where people can buy them offline or they can order them online.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, there are a few negative aspects of having similar shops and products in different countries. First, there is no diversity in designs. Similar designs can be found in different countries. Second, countries lack the authenticity of their local products as they are available or listed on platforms like amazon which allows sellers to sell products internationally. For example, recently one of my colleagues had visited Paris for her vacation. she wanted to do some shopping in Paris however, she could not find any unique design which she can buy as a souvenir. Those same shops and designs were also available in her home country with a minimal variation in price.\r\n\r\nTo sum up, there are many benefits which surpass the negative aspects of having similar shops across the globe as this give a homelike feeling to someone who is planning to stay in a different country for months or years.\n\nProvide your assessment in the specified JSON format."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"per_criterion\": [{\"name\": \"Task Response\", \"band\": 8.0, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"Nowadays, globalisation has led to international trade across many countries\", \"However, now the scenario has changed and many of this brand's shops are available in almost all the countries where people can buy them offline or they can order them online\", \"To sum up, there are many benefits which surpass the negative aspects of having similar shops across the globe as this give a homelike feeling to someone who is planning to stay in a different country for months or years\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"Nowadays, globalisation has led to international trade across many countries\", \"type\": \"task\", \"fix\": \"Consider improving the task response aspect here.\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Develop your main arguments more fully with specific examples.\", \"Ensure you address all parts of the question directly.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Coherence & Cohesion\", \"band\": 7.0, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"Nowadays, globalisation has led to international trade across many countries\", \"However, now the scenario has changed and many of this brand's shops are available in almost all the countries where people can buy them offline or they can order them online\", \"To sum up, there are many benefits which surpass the negative aspects of having similar shops across the globe as this give a homelike feeling to someone who is planning to stay in a different country for months or years\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"Nowadays, globalisation has led to international trade across many countries\", \"type\": \"coherence\", \"fix\": \"Consider improving the coherence & cohesion aspect here.\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Use more varied linking words to connect your ideas.\", \"Improve paragraph structure with clearer topic sentences.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Lexical Resource\", \"band\": 7.0, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"Nowadays, globalisation has led to international trade across many countries\", \"However, now the scenario has changed and many of this brand's shops are available in almost all the countries where people can buy them offline or they can order them online\", \"To sum up, there are many benefits which surpass the negative aspects of having similar shops across the globe as this give a homelike feeling to someone who is planning to stay in a different country for months or years\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"Nowadays, globalisation has led to international trade across many countries\", \"type\": \"lexical\", \"fix\": \"Consider improving the lexical resource aspect here.\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Use more sophisticated vocabulary and avoid repetition.\", \"Focus on precise word choice and natural collocations.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Grammatical Range & Accuracy\", \"band\": 8.0, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"Nowadays, globalisation has led to international trade across many countries\", \"However, now the scenario has changed and many of this brand's shops are available in almost all the countries where people can buy them offline or they can order them online\", \"To sum up, there are many benefits which surpass the negative aspects of having similar shops across the globe as this give a homelike feeling to someone who is planning to stay in a different country for months or years\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"Nowadays, globalisation has led to international trade across many countries\", \"type\": \"grammar\", \"fix\": \"Consider improving the grammatical range & accuracy aspect here.\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Use more complex sentence structures.\", \"Check for grammatical errors and improve accuracy.\"]}], \"overall\": 7.5}"}]}

To what extent do you agree or disagree?\n\nScore this IELTS Task 2 essay according to the rubric, ensuring alignment with the question:\n\nThe traditional educational process typically assumes that students are learning under supervision of a teacher in a classroom. However, there is a tendency to believe that guided learning and other conventional traits of education can be faded away by 2050. I truly believe that the teaching system will be light years ahead of what we have at present moment due to the technological breakthrough and drawbacks of teacher-led lessons. \r\n\r\nFirstly, robots may provide insightful knowledge and assess students’ performance instead of human teachers. Recent technological innovations demonstrate that human labor can be replaced by machines as well as robots are able to perform the same work at the same level. The modern educational system is not the exception for that. Internet is already full of reliable sources, which could be used by students independently. For instance, some schools and esteemed universities such as Cambridge practice autonomous learning via laptops with guidelines. \r\n\r\nSecondly, plenty of situations related to teacher-student relationships shows that there are alarming drawbacks associated with this type of teaching and learning. The human factor leads to some educators having biased attitude towards different students. Thus, unfair evaluation can very likely discourage students from taking part in the subject, thereby they lose natural inquisitiveness. The education authorities are already concerned with this issue, therefore the tradition of teacher-led studying can be replaced by something else in further future. \r\n\r\nTo conclude, I suspect that though studying process is tightly related to guided learning, technological development and detrimental sides of providing information through human will change the perspective of educating systems. \r\n\r\n260 words\n\nProvide your assessment in the specified JSON format."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"per_criterion\": [{\"name\": \"Task Response\", \"band\": 5.5, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"The traditional educational process typically assumes that students are learning under supervision of a teacher in a classroom\", \"Internet is already full of reliable sources, which could be used by students independently\", \"To conclude, I suspect that though studying process is tightly related to guided learning, technological development and detrimental sides of providing information through human will change the perspective of educating systems\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"The traditional educational process typically assumes that students are learning under supervision o\", \"type\": \"task\", \"fix\": \"Consider improving the task response aspect here.\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Develop your main arguments more fully with specific examples.\", \"Ensure you address all parts of the question directly.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Coherence & Cohesion\", \"band\": 4.5, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"The traditional educational process typically assumes that students are learning under supervision of a teacher in a classroom\", \"Internet is already full of reliable sources, which could be used by students independently\", \"To conclude, I suspect that though studying process is tightly related to guided learning, technological development and detrimental sides of providing information through human will change the perspective of educating systems\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"The traditional educational process typically assumes that students are learning under supervision o\", \"type\": \"coherence\", \"fix\": \"Consider improving the coherence & cohesion aspect here.\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Use more varied linking words to connect your ideas.\", \"Improve paragraph structure with clearer topic sentences.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Lexical Resource\", \"band\": 4.5, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"The traditional educational process typically assumes that students are learning under supervision of a teacher in a classroom\", \"Internet is already full of reliable sources, which could be used by students independently\", \"To conclude, I suspect that though studying process is tightly related to guided learning, technological development and detrimental sides of providing information through human will change the perspective of educating systems\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"The traditional educational process typically assumes that students are learning under supervision o\", \"type\": \"lexical\", \"fix\": \"Consider improving the lexical resource aspect here.\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Use more sophisticated vocabulary and avoid repetition.\", \"Focus on precise word choice and natural collocations.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Grammatical Range & Accuracy\", \"band\": 5.5, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"The traditional educational process typically assumes that students are learning under supervision of a teacher in a classroom\", \"Internet is already full of reliable sources, which could be used by students independently\", \"To conclude, I suspect that though studying process is tightly related to guided learning, technological development and detrimental sides of providing information through human will change the perspective of educating systems\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"The traditional educational process typically assumes that students are learning under supervision o\", \"type\": \"grammar\", \"fix\": \"Consider improving the grammatical range & accuracy aspect here.\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Use more complex sentence structures.\", \"Check for grammatical errors and improve accuracy.\"]}], \"overall\": 5.0}"}]}

Some people think that children going to single sex schools have disadvantages later in life.  To what extent do you agree?\n\nScore this IELTS Task 2 essay according to the rubric, ensuring alignment with the question:\n\nIt is commonly argued that children attending single-sex schools will be at a disadvantage in the long run. Personally, I can neither agree nor disagree with this statement for a variety of reasons.\r\n\r\nI partly agree with the opinion that co-ed schools provide better preparation in life for kids. This is because they allow for opposite-gender interactions to occur, mimicking what the real world has to offer. It's through these interactions that kids develop their emotional intelligence and interpersonal relationships, putting them in a better place in life. Due to being exposed to the other sex often, co-ed schools also play a role in helping build confidence around others along with communication skills which are important skills for later on in life. As an example, it has been shown by Yale that emotional intelligence is mainly cultivated through a person's school years  when a diverse group of people to connect with would help immensely in this process. \r\n\r\nOn the other hand, that is not to say that single-sex schools are inherently bad. The reason for this is that single-sex schools provide a comfortable and relaxed learning environment, as everyone shares the same mindset here, being of the same gender. This would reduce double standards and stereotypes, allowing kids to focus more on their education and studies. For example, research from Stanford pointed out how pupils of single-sex schools outperformed their co-ed counterparts by 5-10% in academic grades. Also, aside from the academic aspects of this education system, schools can also provide better mental and wellbeing support, as due to being of the same gender, certain problems unique to each sex can be directly addressed, improving the close-knit bond between teachers and students.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, although it's easy to say that single-sex education lacks diversity, which plays a role in a child's psychological development, it also acts as a way to provide a better learning environment for students, allowing them to achieve better scores in the future.\n\nProvide your assessment in the specified JSON format."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"per_criterion\": [{\"name\": \"Task Response\", \"band\": 8.0, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"It is commonly argued that children attending single-sex schools will be at a disadvantage in the long run\", \"As an example, it has been shown by Yale that emotional intelligence is mainly cultivated through a person's school years  when a diverse group of people to connect with would help immensely in this process\", \"In conclusion, although it's easy to say that single-sex education lacks diversity, which plays a role in a child's psychological development, it also acts as a way to provide a better learning environment for students, allowing them to achieve better scores in the future\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"It is commonly argued that children attending single-sex schools will be at a disadvantage in the lo\", \"type\": \"task\", \"fix\": \"Consider improving the task response aspect here.\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Develop your main arguments more fully with specific examples.\", \"Ensure you address all parts of the question directly.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Coherence & Cohesion\", \"band\": 7.0, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"It is commonly argued that children attending single-sex schools will be at a disadvantage in the long run\", \"As an example, it has been shown by Yale that emotional intelligence is mainly cultivated through a person's school years  when a diverse group of people to connect with would help immensely in this process\", \"In conclusion, although it's easy to say that single-sex education lacks diversity, which plays a role in a child's psychological development, it also acts as a way to provide a better learning environment for students, allowing them to achieve better scores in the future\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"It is commonly argued that children attending single-sex schools will be at a disadvantage in the lo\", \"type\": \"coherence\", \"fix\": \"Consider improving the coherence & cohesion aspect here.\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Use more varied linking words to connect your ideas.\", \"Improve paragraph structure with clearer topic sentences.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Lexical Resource\", \"band\": 7.0, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"It is commonly argued that children attending single-sex schools will be at a disadvantage in the long run\", \"As an example, it has been shown by Yale that emotional intelligence is mainly cultivated through a person's school years  when a diverse group of people to connect with would help immensely in this process\", \"In conclusion, although it's easy to say that single-sex education lacks diversity, which plays a role in a child's psychological development, it also acts as a way to provide a better learning environment for students, allowing them to achieve better scores in the future\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"It is commonly argued that children attending single-sex schools will be at a disadvantage in the lo\", \"type\": \"lexical\", \"fix\": \"Consider improving the lexical resource aspect here.\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Use more sophisticated vocabulary and avoid repetition.\", \"Focus on precise word choice and natural collocations.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Grammatical Range & Accuracy\", \"band\": 8.0, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"It is commonly argued that children attending single-sex schools will be at a disadvantage in the long run\", \"As an example, it has been shown by Yale that emotional intelligence is mainly cultivated through a person's school years  when a diverse group of people to connect with would help immensely in this process\", \"In conclusion, although it's easy to say that single-sex education lacks diversity, which plays a role in a child's psychological development, it also acts as a way to provide a better learning environment for students, allowing them to achieve better scores in the future\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"It is commonly argued that children attending single-sex schools will be at a disadvantage in the lo\", \"type\": \"grammar\", \"fix\": \"Consider improving the grammatical range & accuracy aspect here.\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Use more complex sentence structures.\", \"Check for grammatical errors and improve accuracy.\"]}], \"overall\": 7.5}"}]}

Others, however, think that other measures are needed. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.\"\n\nScore this IELTS Task 2 essay according to the rubric, ensuring alignment with the question:\n\nTraffic congestion has become a ubiquitous challenge in urban areas, leading to increased commute times and environmental concerns. As urban populations continue to grow, the search for effective solutions intensifies. One school of thought asserts that providing free public transportation is the key to alleviating congestion, while an opposing viewpoint argues for alternative measures. In this essay, we will explore both perspectives, examining the advantages of free public transportation as well as the feasibility of alternative approaches. Ultimately, the goal is to weigh the merits of each stance and offer a comprehensive view on the most viable strategies to address the ever-growing issue of traffic congestion in our cities.\r\n\r\nSome proponents argue that providing free public transportation is the most effective solution to address traffic congestion. By removing the financial barrier to using public transport, more people are likely to choose it over private vehicles, thereby reducing the number of cars on the road. For instance, in Singapore, the implementation of free bus services during peak hours resulted in a significant decrease in traffic volume, offering a practical example of the positive impact of this approach.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, skeptics believe that alternative measures are necessary to combat traffic congestion. Congestion pricing, for instance, has proven successful in major cities like London and Stockholm. By charging drivers for entering the city center during peak hours, congestion pricing not only discourages unnecessary trips but also generates revenue for improving public transportation infrastructure. This demonstrates that a multifaceted approach may be more effective than relying solely on free public transportation.\r\n\r\nIn my opinion, while free public transportation can be a valuable component of a comprehensive strategy, it should not be the sole focus. Combining initiatives such as congestion pricing, the development of cycling infrastructure, and the promotion of carpooling can create a more sustainable and adaptable solution. This balanced approach addresses the diverse needs of urban populations and offers a more realistic path toward reducing traffic congestion in our cities.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, the debate over how best to mitigate traffic congestion in urban areas is complex and multifaceted. While advocates of free public transportation emphasize its potential to reduce the number of private vehicles on the road, proponents of alternative measures, such as congestion pricing, highlight the need for a diversified approach. After considering both views, it is my contention that a balanced strategy, incorporating elements of free public transportation alongside other measures, presents a more realistic and sustainable solution. By embracing a comprehensive perspective, cities can not only enhance mobility for their residents but also contribute to the creation of more environmentally friendly and efficient urban environments.

Also,they can share everything with each other including personal matters without any kind of shyness,moreover, young students learn easily and faster due to peer pressure which help in their academics. For instance, according to the survey of 'Times of Japan' 90% school school students perform better because they study with their same age friends during the lockdown period.

In this essay, I will explain both possessions and I am going to tell my belief about this discussion.\n\nThe primary factor we need to take into consideration is that in today's society there is like a rule that if you want a successful career, you must graduate from university. Right after school, it is almost impossible to get a job. This is because a person needs specific basics and knowledge in order to start working in any particular profession. Therefore, the employer always requires that you have completed certain studies at a university or college, this is the modern norm. It is true that in university people don’t get real job experience, but those education institutions prepare and lay the foundations for your future work activities, which is very important. In contrast, some others may claim that you don’t need a bachelor or master’s degree to reach a successful career. The knowledge that is acquired at universities is usually not that useful at work, because it is simply not needed. It is obvious that you will not start with the highest positions only after you are employed. Everything happens gradually, step by step, and everything becomes understandable, and you will learn many new things through a job that would not be taught at the university.\n\nHaving considered both views, I think it is necessary to graduate from an educational institution and get a degree.

Despite that, people still consider that opting for job straight after secondary education is more beneficial. Similarly, I believe that securing job after school is a more viable option these days.\n\nHowever, a large section of our society still gives preference to higher learning as it provides a better salary and a chance to become a researcher or scientist. As per the World Economic Forum report of 2016, people with graduation or post-graduation tend to secure a high paying work as compared to a high school pass-out. Even the standard of living was far higher for people with a degree, and the chances of doing research were also high. Most of the scientific breakthroughs are made by people with higher study: Abhijeet Banerjee was a graduate of Harvard University who was given the noble prize in 2016 for his exceptional performance in economics. Thus, higher schooling is considered a way for moving up in the society.\n\nNevertheless, there are advocates for people going for jobs before college. It has become a common trend these days for people entering the workforce without a degree as it is considered useless by many people: in 2017, more than 46% of the unemployed in the United States were university graduates. This has created fear among people, and now more and more students are looking for jobs rather than going for research job which requires a degree. So, we are observing that work has become a priority for many people rather than studying in esteemed universities.\n\nEven, I also consider that we should opt for a job after secondary education as college learning is very expensive and requires hard-work. Everyone does not have the funds to support their study, therefore school learning is considered more than enough as it allows to earn livelihood. Universities require focus and determination, a lot of universities do research which is not a cup of tea for everyone. Therefore, a dramatic rise can be seen in the number of people entering the industry without a degree.\n\nTo summarize, there are advantages and disadvantages of college learning and people have different preferences, but high school  is more beneficial as it saves money, and provides enough knowledge and skills to tackle problems in life.\n\nProvide your assessment in the specified JSON format."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"per_criterion\": [{\"name\": \"Task Response\", \"band\": 7.5, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"Today, university schooling is available to every individual who wishes to make a prosperous career\", \"Nevertheless, there are advocates for people going for jobs before college\", \"To summarize, there are advantages and disadvantages of college learning and people have different preferences, but high school  is more beneficial as it saves money, and provides enough knowledge and skills to tackle problems in life\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"Today, university schooling is available to every individual who wishes to make a prosperous career\", \"type\": \"task\", \"fix\": \"Consider improving the task response aspect here.\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Develop your main arguments more fully with specific examples.\", \"Ensure you address all parts of the question directly.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Coherence & Cohesion\", \"band\": 6.5, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"Today, university schooling is available to every individual who wishes to make a prosperous career\", \"Nevertheless, there are advocates for people going for jobs before college\", \"To summarize, there are advantages and disadvantages of college learning and people have different preferences, but high school  is more beneficial as it saves money, and provides enough knowledge and skills to tackle problems in life\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"Today, university schooling is available to every individual who wishes to make a prosperous career\", \"type\": \"coherence\", \"fix\": \"Consider improving the coherence & cohesion aspect here.\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Use more varied linking words to connect your ideas.\", \"Improve paragraph structure with clearer topic sentences.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Lexical Resource\", \"band\": 6.5, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"Today, university schooling is available to every individual who wishes to make a prosperous career\", \"Nevertheless, there are advocates for people going for jobs before college\", \"To summarize, there are advantages and disadvantages of college learning and people have different preferences, but high school  is more beneficial as it saves money, and provides enough knowledge and skills to tackle problems in life\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"Today, university schooling is available to every individual who wishes to make a prosperous career\", \"type\": \"lexical\", \"fix\": \"Consider improving the lexical resource aspect here.\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Use more sophisticated vocabulary and avoid repetition.\", \"Focus on precise word choice and natural collocations.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Grammatical Range & Accuracy\", \"band\": 7.5, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"Today, university schooling is available to every individual who wishes to make a prosperous career\", \"Nevertheless, there are advocates for people going for jobs before college\", \"To summarize, there are advantages and disadvantages of college learning and people have different preferences, but high school  is more beneficial as it saves money, and provides enough knowledge and skills to tackle problems in life\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"Today, university schooling is available to every individual who wishes to make a prosperous career\", \"type\": \"grammar\", \"fix\": \"Consider improving the grammatical range & accuracy aspect here.\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Use more complex sentence structures.\", \"Check for grammatical errors and improve accuracy.\"]}], \"overall\": 7.0}"}]}

Secondly, inhabitants can ask their neighbors who have lived for a long time in a place. They might have experienced, heard a significant number of stories and superstitions.

This essay completely agrees with that statement because it will surely help these children learn social skills and will also benefit the community in multiple ways.\r\n\r\nTeenagers who do community work often get a chance to deal with different kinds of people and this helps them learn social skills. While dealing with people, youngsters get to listen to the needs of the community which will help build their skills to communicate and socialize with them. Many students pay loads of money to get educated and learn these skills, but with unpaid community work, these skills can be learnt for free. For example, a survey conducted by the UK university shows that more than 85% of the children who take part in any unpaid social work usually carry better social skills than those who do not.\r\n\r\nAnother reason is that it will help society in numerous ways.

Firstly, the government has to make the rules and regulations of traffic jams very strict. Secondly, those who will not follow these rules have to give a huge amount of fines.

According to an article published in \"THE TIMES\", the students who explored these sites as their history assignment, achieved more success than other students in their exams. Besides this, feeling proud about their identity is an another possible reason. Because of the globalisation the world has become a smaller place, these places serves as a medium to connect people to their traditional roots,and also develop a social bond between them. As a result, they are proud of their national identities and its values.\r\n\r\nTo conclude, while there are valid arguments on both sides, I believe museums have an equally important role to serve as a leisure activity as well as for education, and people have sole right to decide upon what they want to do.\n\nProvide your assessment in the specified JSON format."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"per_criterion\": [{\"name\": \"Task Response\", \"band\": 6.5, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"The role of museums in our lives has been widely debated\", \"Conversely, these museums are the symbol of our cultural history, identity, and traditions\", \"To conclude, while there are valid arguments on both sides, I believe museums have an equally important role to serve as a leisure activity as well as for education, and people have sole right to decide upon what they want to do\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"The role of museums in our lives has been widely debated\", \"type\": \"task\", \"fix\": \"Consider improving the task response aspect here.\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Develop your main arguments more fully with specific examples.\", \"Ensure you address all parts of the question directly.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Coherence & Cohesion\", \"band\": 5.5, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"The role of museums in our lives has been widely debated\", \"Conversely, these museums are the symbol of our cultural history, identity, and traditions\", \"To conclude, while there are valid arguments on both sides, I believe museums have an equally important role to serve as a leisure activity as well as for education, and people have sole right to decide upon what they want to do\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"The role of museums in our lives has been widely debated\", \"type\": \"coherence\", \"fix\": \"Consider improving the coherence & cohesion aspect here.\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Use more varied linking words to connect your ideas.\", \"Improve paragraph structure with clearer topic sentences.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Lexical Resource\", \"band\": 5.5, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"The role of museums in our lives has been widely debated\", \"Conversely, these museums are the symbol of our cultural history, identity, and traditions\", \"To conclude, while there are valid arguments on both sides, I believe museums have an equally important role to serve as a leisure activity as well as for education, and people have sole right to decide upon what they want to do\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"The role of museums in our lives has been widely debated\", \"type\": \"lexical\", \"fix\": \"Consider improving the lexical resource aspect here.\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Use more sophisticated vocabulary and avoid repetition.\", \"Focus on precise word choice and natural collocations.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Grammatical Range & Accuracy\", \"band\": 6.5, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"The role of museums in our lives has been widely debated\", \"Conversely, these museums are the symbol of our cultural history, identity, and traditions\", \"To conclude, while there are valid arguments on both sides, I believe museums have an equally important role to serve as a leisure activity as well as for education, and people have sole right to decide upon what they want to do\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"The role of museums in our lives has been widely debated\", \"type\": \"grammar\", \"fix\": \"Consider improving the grammatical range & accuracy aspect here.\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Use more complex sentence structures.\", \"Check for grammatical errors and improve accuracy.\"]}], \"overall\": 6.0}"}]}

Moreover, if the punishment applies to young people, they will remember and will not be reoffended.

Moreover,if the kids get involved in criminal activities, it is probably because the parents did not teach to their children distinguish white from black in government.

However, some people believe that better education will be a more effective solution. To what extent do you agree or disagree?\n\nScore this IELTS Task 2 essay according to the rubric, ensuring alignment with the question:\n\nIn this day and age, with the advent of modern society, there has become increasingly social evils. It, therefore, has been debatable while in several countries, they firmly believe that imprisonment is the best effective solution to lawbreakers, others think that it will be a good solution to educate offenders. According to my knowledge, I totally agree with the former view.\r\n\r\nOn the one hand, there is a wide range of compelling reasons to account for this. One evident strength is that prisons are important places that play a significant role in making sure  social security. In prisons, there is a host of policemen who assumes the responsibility of capturing criminals and giving out some reasonable punishments to punish them. Especially for dangerous lawbreakers such as rapists or murders have to receive the death penalty or be sentenced to jail for a long time to warn them. In other words, If a nation doesn’t have imprisonment for those committing felonies, there will be  thousands of people are able to be killed annually. Take Vietnam as a good example, thanks to enacting life imprisonment, the number of crimes declined considerably.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, there also have good education programmes which the authorities enact to guarantee that prisoners have a keen knowledge of social life and perceive what is morally right or wrong to steer clear of offending the crime down the road.

To what extent do you agree or disagree?\n\nScore this IELTS Task 2 essay according to the rubric, ensuring alignment with the question:\n\nInveigled by their aroma and the gut’s responsive bleat, people today have been completely ensnared by their favourite fast-food treat. However, this transient decoy comes with its ramifications. The primary causative effect that it causes is a fallacious and unhealthy body mass index of people owing to their obesity. To this, some people peddle forth to increase the selling prices of such fast-food products causing health hazards. However, I would differ from the viewpoint presented. In the subsequent paragraphs, I shall propound my views on the issue. \r\n\r\nTo begin with, as is rife, modernization has caused and paved the way for the cornered sections of the society to be educated, empowered, and employable, and with it, more and more working professionals have come along. With more people entangled in their daily workloads, lesser emphasis has thus naturally been on cooking the meals at home, and more so, the hoopla of managing both has certainly been overwhelming and making one feel work like a trojan. In such a “click and flick” era where a significant number of people may approach their fast-food outlets easily, simply putting a higher price quotation couldn’t ever curb people from consuming and feasting on junk food. More so, as is found in a survey, people falling in the bracket of the upper class with an above-average income, are found to be the steadfast consumers of such packaged and unhealthy meals. Hence, as is pretty comprehensible, raising the prices of these eatables wouldn’t make much of a dent in the pockets of people who may afford it easily. \r\n\r\nThe wages of people in concomitance to what they could frugally spend would be negligible, even after upheaving the taxes on such edible items. The striking need of the hour is to make people more aware of the cataclysmic causes of having such food that might render them extremely unhealthy and frail. Acknowledging people with the detrimental corollary and pernicious eventualities of having an imbalanced diet and a decrepit BMI may keep them alarmed and watchful of what they are being served or choose to be served with to eat.

In this essay, I will discuss both views. \r\n\r\nFirst of all, we cannot deny that museums are many people's favourite because visiting them is usually a very enjoyable experience. It is a place for both young ones and the elderly to visit. Some museums serve as locations for companies to organise exclusive dinners as they provide a unique background to make the experience a very special one. Furthermore ,generally we all like places that are pleasant and fun for family to hang out, creating stronger bonds among the family members. \r\n\r\nNonetheless, museums are built essentially to educate people about the history and development of a country . For instance, monuments and pictures in museums show what happened in the past. Some historical tools that are displayed in the museums illustrate equipment that was used by our ancestors in encountering their daily life's challenges. All these can teach the younger generations to appreciate the sacrifices and contributions of the previous generations. Moreover, we also learn not to repeat the mistakes that were made in the past, making us a better and stronger nation today. \r\n\r\nIn summary,  museums are important places which work not only to entertain the general public,but also to educate us .

However, others reckon that this activity does not affect the artists. I think that there is a negative impact on musician performances.\r\n\r\nOn the one hand, nowadays we see some breaches in terms of illegal downloading of their favorite music songs. This is because there are throngs of people who would like to get music singles with no fee, which causes a detrimental impact on musician’s profit. Consequently, they may lose their inspiration and it can lead to their poor performance with all that entails. I agree that this may have a fruitless effect on not only their future concert tours but in general on their future career. For instance, some popular singers in the UK have left their music industry because they do not get enough motivation and reward from their fans, who do not visit their performances.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, there are no downsides in the proliferation of downloading their music through websites. This is because they earn a chunk of income sources, which is usually made by singers, such as: concert tours, a bunch of private concerts and shows.Besides, publishing their music on YouTube provides them a tremendous effect and income,where they can earn some money on watching and downloading their songs from it. Conversely, they have a prosperous life without making ends meet. \r\n\r\nIn conclusion, I reckon that there is a negative result from illegally downloading songs via the Internet.

To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?\n\nScore this IELTS Task 2 essay according to the rubric, ensuring alignment with the question:\n\nIt is argued that technological advancements in the field of communication have adversely affected one's personal and professional relationships. Personally, I strongly disagree with this view.\r\nAs new ways of communicating with one another, such as mobile phones and social networks, are introduced, some fear that people might become socially isolated. Their rationale is that these technologies, which promote communication in virtual reality, have marginalized physical interaction and thus may potentially fracture concrete relationships. However, this claim is largely exaggerated. In reality, virtual interaction augments social relationships rather than undermines them. For example, most Facebook users talk to friends and colleagues both through the social network and in person. The extra features that Facebook provides like instant messaging and video calling do not substitute for having a conversation in real life, but merely help us stay connected over long distances.\r\nI am convinced there is further evidence to suggest that innovations in communication exist not to the detriment of social relationships, but rather to their benefit. Not only do they address the question of distance as demonstrated above, these tools also help us to expand our social circles. For instance, online food forums connect people who share a passion for culinary arts, while photo-sharing applications like Instalgram can bring together a group of individuals who have the same taste in fashion. These examples are a testament to how technology establishes communities and promotes interaction among people.\r\nIn conclusion, there are sufficient grounds to reject the view that social relationships might be jeopardized by the advent of advanced communication technologies.

Do you think the advantages of this development outweigh the disadvantages?\n\nScore this IELTS Task 2 essay according to the rubric, ensuring alignment with the question:\n\nThe rapid advance of technology now allows computers and robots to perform tasks that previously carried out by people and consequently, generates inevitable threats to those professions. People are divided in opinion about whether the advantages of this phenomenon exceed the disadvantages. This essay will show that the positive impacts do not surpass the setbacks by a couple of reasons.\r\n\r\nThe first reason to highlight is that robots and computers cannot deliberately adapt to unparalleled situations arise in most jobs. Although robots and computers performs excellent and efficient job, they can do it because they have a series of steps that previously planted to their system. When the system cannot recognise a new situation or new problem, the system cannot perform the job since the steps to handle the situation did not set before.\r\n\r\nThe second argument to notice is that computers and robots enormously rely on electricity. The mass use of computers and robots will be likely to give a large amount of burden to electrical system.

I agree with former argument that art is impeccable for holistic mind growth in children.\nOn the one hand, it is often argued that there is no tangible benefit of studying arts. This is because there are very limited career prospects for people who study arts. For example, people with a qualification in arts often find it difficult to secure a job which is permanent and well paid. In contrast, people with a credential in other disciplines such as business, engineering or medical, conveniently find jobs which are not only permanent and well paid but also recognized highly in the society.  \nOn the other hand, I would disagree that since art is a useless subject because it does not offer a well awarded career.

This not only improve their communication skills but also enhance their emotional quotient which helps them substantially later in their future careers.\nIn conclusion, while other people’s opinions may vary, I think that art plays an inevitable role in the overall mindset development of children which helps them to enhance their communication skills and emotional quotient for their future challenges.

This means that they have become aspects of life with great global significance as a result many nations are working together to tackle this areas of human existence. A group of people have suggested that the collaboration between countries are more towards safekeeping the environs other than promoting business whereas another group are of the opinion that the reverse is the case. I belong to the school of thought who believes that the most important reason for interregional relations is to ehance and explore global business.\r\n\r\nFirstly, trade provides funding for the smooth running of the society. Humans are known to be deficient in some of the things they require for their basic needs, hence, the need to exchange what one possesses in return for what he needs. This can been expressed also among countries as each country has its own resources and may depend on other countries to get what they are lacking. For example, the international relationship between the USA and Nigeria has promoted the trade of crude oil and its products among these nations.In addition, mutual interest in trade stands as a protection for the regions involved. Communities are more interested in building business connections with other communities because of the peace that it may provide. This prevents the economic disruption that may face both countries if they are at war with each other. An example of this can be seen in the relationships between China and other countries.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand , one of the major points that suggests that international relationships are more favourable towards keeping the environment safe is the fact that it unifies the pursuit towards a better climate. With data and contributions from different regions, all aspects of the ecosystem will be properly addressed in order to manage the problems perculiar to each region.

While I agree that schools can transform children into useful members of society, I believe that they also bring benefits to students themselves.\n\nOn the one hand, turning children into useful citizens is the main purpose of schools. The primary reason is that the same core subjects such as math, literature and civic education are present in the curriculum of most schools. Children, therefore, are expected to share the same moral standards, general knowledge and skills. If all members of society were to have such criteria, society would become more stable and civilized as the crime rate would be low. If schools were to fail to equip their students with needed skills or standards, they would not become productive members of society.  Thus, it is understandable why schools’ main responsibility is to producing good members of society.\n\nOn the other hand, it can argued that children themselves can reap of number of benefits. When children are taught a wide range of subjects, they can have the opportunity to become more well-rounded and widen their outlook on life. This would help them to be able to adapt to a new environment in their later life. Another benefit would be that schools are a perfect environment for students to develop their communication skill. This is largely because they are enabled to make friends with their classmates and talk to them virtually on a daily basis.

Personally, I completely agree with this statement because it will lead to positive outcomes for students' performance. \r\n\r\nTeaching students to work together with other school-children through team sports is advantageous and beneficial. Primarily,  team sport involves a cordial relationship between school children. For example, team games where numerous students are taking part to help  isolated ones to perform better. Additionally, it helps  to broaden perspectives because of sharing, exchanging ideas and information with peers. Hence, it provides to children to be open-minded, overcome shyness in a new unknown environment and learn more information from their classmates.\r\n\r\nApart from being socialized, team games boost the interpersonal skills of students. In other words, members of the game adapted to listen to others' opinions and  have the same rights to speak.

Thus, these skills will be vital to students further and provide  numerous benefits, namely being a comfortable person as well as a colleague.\r\n\r\nTo conclude,  the best method in order to promote cooperating skills in students is to teach them through team games at school.

This essay attempts to identify the causes of this matter and provides a solution for diminishing the consequence to the climate.\n\nThe harm to the surroundings derives from the companies’ release of vinegar and the lack of people’s awareness. For the former, with the dramatic growth of population, more and more products have been manufactured in order to severe individual purposes in many aspects of life. This act leads to  mass production which requires enterprises to operate at full capacity to satisfy the considerable consumption of billions of people throughout the world. If those businesses are run without stopping to handle chemicals from manufacturing, these tonnes of chemicals, which contain contaminating substances, will be discharged to the rivers, and beaches which cause adversely to the water environment. Furthermore, another cause can be mentioned as the deficiency of residents’ awareness. Some people hold the view their consumption on clothing, plastic products are not sizeable so they do not need to take action to recycle after using those products for once. For that reason, their waste can be the pollutants to the surroundings from the processing methods, namely burning which results in  air pollution.

However some people think that interview is not a reliable method of choosing whom to employ.\nTo what extent do you agree or disagree?\n\nScore this IELTS Task 2 essay according to the rubric, ensuring alignment with the question:\n\nInterviews are typically the primary selection criteria for large companies. There is some criticism of using interviews to recruit employees, with the argument that this method is ineffective. I agree that there are ways to improve the accuracy of the hiring process. Group activities and personality quizzes can be used in addition to interviews to get a better sense of who would be a good fit for the job.\n\n \n\nThe importance of interviewing when it comes to selecting new individuals to integrate a team cannot be dinned. It has proved to be the most traditional and practical framework largely adopted worldwide. They can offer vital insights about an applicant and lead to more informed decisions. However, individuals often act like robots when being interviewed, answering questions in a way recruiters will be happy about. Hence, other approaches should be introduced for a more holistic understanding of the candidate's capabilities.\n\n \n\nModern organisations are already introducing new techniques to choose4 the best matches for their teams. These contemporary assessments evaluate professionals during activities designed to capture the candidate's behaviour in complex situations where pressure and conflicts are common.  In this case, applicants tend to express their real selves, values and logical thinking. These findings are then combined with the interview results in a profile-matching exercise.\n\n \n\nAnother way to further assess the job seekers' profiles is by assigning them personality quizzes. Quizzes are powerful tools that can be used to gather information about a professional’s strengths and weaknesses. In addition, such tests can detect which professionals can naturally act like mediators and which need to be led by others. Thus, they can assist in allocating workers to the right team and role.\n\n \n\nIn conclusion, interviews will always be important as they are still insightful, simple, and straightforward, demanding minimum resources to be executed.

The root of the argument lies in the fact that it is easy to find real-life examples in both  cases. In the following paragraphs, I will discuss both  sides and conclude with my opinion on the same.\n\nThe opinion that a job directly after school is the best route to a fruitful career may involve the recognition of the fact that people who have hands-on experience generally perform better in a given task than those who just have theoretical understanding. Moreover, in a job an individual faces and solves real problems that an organisation or a business faces versus simulated ones provided at university or a college. Many companies, nowadays, do not even check academic credentials if a candidate has relevant skills required for the job. Google is one such example. \n\nOn the flip side, not every industry is privileged enough to provide job opportunities straight out of school. For instance, medical practitioners need to have a degree certain understanding and knowledge before handling practical cases. Additionally, universities and colleges have been preparing people for centuries for the job market. There are numerous benefits of preparation under simulated environments such as freedom to be creative in problem-solving which might not be possible in a job. Along with the studies, youngsters sometimes develops or find their passion for different subjects such as art, theatre, singing etc.\n\nIn my opinion, there are relevant benefits of both  sides and if possible authorities should try using both for the benefit of the students.

Discuss both views and give your opinion.\n\nScore this IELTS Task 2 essay according to the rubric, ensuring alignment with the question:\n\nThe development of globalization has boosted economic cooperation and cultural exchange between countries. Following that, many positive benefits are created. Nevertheless, other people disagree because they think that these contacts will make many countries lose their cultural traditions. \nThere are many reasons why people support and stimulate business and cultural contacts between countries. First of all, expanding international cooperation can create positive impacts on the economic aspect of each country. Indeed, businesses have opportunities to widen the market and set up companies beyond its home territory,  so it helps address employment issues and enhance income for humans of that country. Moreover, host  companies also have opportunities to reach new potential customers and attract foreign investment capital so as to promote business operations. In terms of culture, multinational cooperation facilitates countries to  exchange and research each other’s culture values without fearing about barriers,  especially through tourism. The cultural tradition of nation  will be shared and more widely  known instead of just within the scope of a country.  As a result, these cultures will have chances to be preserved and developed. So, from my perspective I also support that countries throughout the world should intensify international cooperation. Because I think it is an effective method to shorten economic gaps as well as to exchange and develop national cultures.\nIn contrast to the above, many people strongly oppose it  because they are afraid of the wear and tear of cultural values. Firstly, the introduction of external cultural values can  gradually overwhelm and take the place of the core traditional values  of the homeland. One instance to clarify this point is that the appearance of holidays such as Valentine day, Halloween and so on which are increasingly interested  in by young Vietnamese people compared to traditional holidays.

What are the causes of this? What can be done to solve this problem?\n\nScore this IELTS Task 2 essay according to the rubric, ensuring alignment with the question:\n\nThe increasing demand for consumer goods causes a great threat to the environment. In my opinion, there are plenty of reasons for this issue. However, I strongly believe that we could take some measures to solve this problem.\n\nThere are numerous reasons why an increase in manufacturing activities can cause damage to natural habitats. First and foremost, as more goods are produced, the number of wastes and exhaust fumes increases. For example, in the manufacturing process, more toxic wastes and emissions are released from factories to nature, which leads to two serious environmental problems including water pollution and air pollution, causing the death of many animal species. Secondly, most food is sold in non-biodegradable plastic packing. However, these products are very hard to decompose and can remain for thousands of years. As a result, packaging could end up in landfill sites and pose a threat to the living habitats.\n\nNevertheless, individuals and governments can join hands to mitigate the problem. Governments could introduce laws to limit emissions from factories. In addition, they should invest in renewable energy. Take European Union as an example, they comply with a regulation that allows countries to buy carbon credits, ban plastic bags, and encourage renewable energies such as solar and wind power. Moreover, individuals should also try to be greener. In other words, each person should choose products with less packaging and recycle as much as possible, which helps save energy and raw materials. \n\nIn conclusion, although the expansion of consumer goods production results in environmental destruction because of two main reasons mentioned above, there are actions which can be taken by people and the government in order to deal with this problem.\n\nProvide your assessment in the specified JSON format."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"per_criterion\": [{\"name\": \"Coherence & Cohesion\", \"band\": 7.5, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"The increasing demand for consumer goods causes a great threat to the environment\", \"As a result, packaging could end up in landfill sites and pose a threat to the living habitats\", \"In conclusion, although the expansion of consumer goods production results in environmental destruction because of two main reasons mentioned above, there are actions which can be taken by people and the government in order to deal with this problem\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"The increasing demand for consumer goods causes a great threat to the environment\", \"type\": \"coherence\", \"fix\": \"Consider improving the coherence & cohesion aspect here.\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Use more varied linking words to connect your ideas.\", \"Improve paragraph structure with clearer topic sentences.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Task Response\", \"band\": 8.0, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"The increasing demand for consumer goods causes a great threat to the environment\", \"As a result, packaging could end up in landfill sites and pose a threat to the living habitats\", \"In conclusion, although the expansion of consumer goods production results in environmental destruction because of two main reasons mentioned above, there are actions which can be taken by people and the government in order to deal with this problem\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"The increasing demand for consumer goods causes a great threat to the environment\", \"type\": \"task\", \"fix\": \"Consider improving the task response aspect here.\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Develop your main arguments more fully with specific examples.\", \"Ensure you address all parts of the question directly.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Lexical Resource\", \"band\": 7.0, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"The increasing demand for consumer goods causes a great threat to the environment\", \"As a result, packaging could end up in landfill sites and pose a threat to the living habitats\", \"In conclusion, although the expansion of consumer goods production results in environmental destruction because of two main reasons mentioned above, there are actions which can be taken by people and the government in order to deal with this problem\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"The increasing demand for consumer goods causes a great threat to the environment\", \"type\": \"lexical\", \"fix\": \"Consider improving the lexical resource aspect here.\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Use more sophisticated vocabulary and avoid repetition.\", \"Focus on precise word choice and natural collocations.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Grammatical Range & Accuracy\", \"band\": 7.0, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"The increasing demand for consumer goods causes a great threat to the environment\", \"As a result, packaging could end up in landfill sites and pose a threat to the living habitats\", \"In conclusion, although the expansion of consumer goods production results in environmental destruction because of two main reasons mentioned above, there are actions which can be taken by people and the government in order to deal with this problem\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"The increasing demand for consumer goods causes a great threat to the environment\", \"type\": \"grammar\", \"fix\": \"Consider improving the grammatical range & accuracy aspect here.\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Use more complex sentence structures.\", \"Check for grammatical errors and improve accuracy.\"]}], \"overall\": 7.5}"}]}

In my opinion, i somewhat agree with this, however i believe that both education and sport are important.\r\n\r\nFirst of all, these days, the parents may realize that their children spend some of their time at home doing various works including studying. So, they encourage them to spend more time doing exercises. One of the main reasons can be that nowadays children can gain weight,less communication with people, or having a weak health. This means that they could manage their time and do physical activities. Another reason can be that children can have a variety of works during that day beside studying. For instance, a latest research showed that daily routine may not develop the person's personality.\r\n\r\nSecondly, it is also possible to make the opposing case that studying is the basic of the children too, and parents have to be aware of this also. One of the major reasons can be that the education these days is necessary for children and for their future. The second point is that children might addict sports and become careless about studying. A particularly good example here is that some recent statistics showed that most of football players were having low marks in high school because of spending more time playing soccer during their childhood. \r\n\r\nTo sum up, while some people believe that parents should promote their children to exercise, i believe that both education and sports are important.\n\nProvide your assessment in the specified JSON format."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"per_criterion\": [{\"name\": \"Task Response\", \"band\": 6.5, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"It is believed that parents should advice their kids to do sport activities instead of spending more time studying\", \"Another reason can be that children can have a variety of works during that day beside studying\", \"To sum up, while some people believe that parents should promote their children to exercise, i believe that both education and sports are important\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"It is believed that parents should advice their kids to do sport activities instead of spending more\", \"type\": \"task\", \"fix\": \"Consider improving the task response aspect here.\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Develop your main arguments more fully with specific examples.\", \"Ensure you address all parts of the question directly.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Coherence & Cohesion\", \"band\": 5.5, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"It is believed that parents should advice their kids to do sport activities instead of spending more time studying\", \"Another reason can be that children can have a variety of works during that day beside studying\", \"To sum up, while some people believe that parents should promote their children to exercise, i believe that both education and sports are important\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"It is believed that parents should advice their kids to do sport activities instead of spending more\", \"type\": \"coherence\", \"fix\": \"Consider improving the coherence & cohesion aspect here.\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Use more varied linking words to connect your ideas.\", \"Improve paragraph structure with clearer topic sentences.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Lexical Resource\", \"band\": 5.5, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"It is believed that parents should advice their kids to do sport activities instead of spending more time studying\", \"Another reason can be that children can have a variety of works during that day beside studying\", \"To sum up, while some people believe that parents should promote their children to exercise, i believe that both education and sports are important\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"It is believed that parents should advice their kids to do sport activities instead of spending more\", \"type\": \"lexical\", \"fix\": \"Consider improving the lexical resource aspect here.\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Use more sophisticated vocabulary and avoid repetition.\", \"Focus on precise word choice and natural collocations.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Grammatical Range & Accuracy\", \"band\": 6.5, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"It is believed that parents should advice their kids to do sport activities instead of spending more time studying\", \"Another reason can be that children can have a variety of works during that day beside studying\", \"To sum up, while some people believe that parents should promote their children to exercise, i believe that both education and sports are important\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"It is believed that parents should advice their kids to do sport activities instead of spending more\", \"type\": \"grammar\", \"fix\": \"Consider improving the grammatical range & accuracy aspect here.\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Use more complex sentence structures.\", \"Check for grammatical errors and improve accuracy.\"]}], \"overall\": 6.0}"}]}

Nowadays, increasing fuel costs wouldn't be adequate to solve environmental issues since the community would continue using primary and faster transport. In addition, other reasons are included for the ecological unbalance, such as the deforest, Agropecuario, humans, etc. Thus, I strongly disagree with this trying solution.\r\n\r\nFirst of all, the car's engines have been changed to hybrid and electric cars, which helps solve some of the issues. Said that, would be a good action by the factors to reduce the price of these types of vehicles. Additionally, more encouragement through some Public Policies made by the government and businesses with multimedia marketing to society starting to ride bikes, take the bus, or walk to their destinations instead of using the car. Second, a clear example that increasing fuel prices may not work is represented by the war between Russia and Ukraine, where the public continued filling their gas transport; instead, they only complained about the high costs.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, the high demand for meat, eggs, and dairy products humans has been contributing to the increase in deforestation. Thus, with plain land, the farmers or factories can raise more farm animals, like cows, goats, pigs, and chickens. These animals also pollute the land, rivers, and air on a large scale. On the other hand, another problem starts with the pollution everyone makes every day by not throwing the trash properly. This action impacts the whole cycle of nature and increases an environmental imbalance.\r\n\r\nIn general, changing other sectors of life, such as changes in vehicle engines and ecological reeducation, would help Mother Nature not to collapse in the future.

To what extent do you agree or disagree?\n\nScore this IELTS Task 2 essay according to the rubric, ensuring alignment with the question:\n\nThe assertion that team sports are the best method to teach youngsters how to cooperate is a viewpoint that has gained considerable attention. Although team sports can indeed foster collaboration skills, I believe that there are other effective avenues for teaching cooperation as well.\r\n\r\nEssentially, team sports are very efficient when it comes to teaching young people how to cooperate with each other. Through a competitive environment, teenagers develop teamwork skills, self-esteem and strategising. For example, students can have many opportunities to recognise the strengths as well as the shortcomings of each teammate which can be used to better compete against their opponents, especially in sports with more than 5 participants such as football, volleyball and basketball. Additionally, playing sports also stimulates a working environment where people work towards a common goal together. Thus, pupils learn how to work together more effectively when they engage in these sporting activities.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, it is important to recognize that cooperation skills can be cultivated through a range of activities beyond team sports. Firstly, cooperative learning strategies in classrooms, group projects, community service activities and even creative pursuits like theatre or music can also provide valuable opportunities for young adults to develop collaboration skills. In fact, these activities promote cooperation, and the ability to work effectively in a group setting. They encourage the youth to understand diverse perspectives, value teamwork and appreciate the benefit of collective effort. Secondly, not all offspring may be inclined toward or have the opportunity to participate in team sports. Thus, it is essential to provide a range of activities and environments that cater to diverse interests or abilities, ensuring that all youngsters have a chance to develop their cooperation skills.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, while team sports offer valuable opportunities for teaching offspring to cooperate, I believe that cooperation skills can be developed through a variety of activities and environments.

In my perspective, I could only partially agree with opinions as such, since there are other ways to achieve the same goals.\r\n\r\nTo begin with, it is inevitable that playing group sports could train young individuals to work together, such as playing volleyball and baseball. To win a game, youth need to learn how to support others instead of focusing on personal performance. It is similar to working in companies as part of teams, where employees will have better results by supporting each other.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, there are other means of teaching to facilitate the capacity of cooperation, including group presentations, or throwing big events on campuses. It provides more opportunities for students to discuss detail, or brainstorm with group members to come up with solutions and ideas to address problems. Group members with different backgrounds and interesting could teach students to embrace different inputs and explore different possibilities. For example, some universities ask students to hold final exhibitions before graduating which requires the participants of the whole class. It forces students to step out of their small social circle and learn how to work in a diverse environment, preparing them for real societies. \r\n\r\n  \r\n\r\nTo conclude, it is true that playing group sports could enhance the capacity for cooperation, since they need to work together to win games.

Many people argue that the ideal solution is to raise the fuel cost, that powers the vehicle. However, this essay disagrees with such a school of thought owing to more cons than its pros, since a surge in fuel prices is not a viable solution at all.\r\n\r\nTo start with, the majority of people prefer private vehicles for their personal use, offices, schools, businesses, picnics, and so on. Though it seemed logical to promote public transport while raising the price of power consumed by vehicles, however, this is not a systematic solution to the real problem. Moreover, the larger and giant economies of the world should be held accountable for the worsening the climate of globe.

Knowledge could be seem as the background and it is easier to train to a person who already have basic insight in certain field to match the job requirment. Therefore, the company can retain money and time on training . Beside, after training course, the company also has more advanced employees.The secondly reason that qualification can evidence that people has spent a long time in training. They have a lot of practice experience and have been trained to have a professional working attitude so it will be easier to work and interact with them.So that, when the boss has an important mission to entrust,they might be the person that boss trusts with tasks without worrying.\n\nIn addition, social skills are also necessary when looking a employment . You can not develop completely your caree without social skills . If a person only learns proffesion knowledge without interactions and communication. Good communication can create sympathy for your boss and colleagues. For example, an worker can create sympathy for customers thanks to skillful speaking.

Why do you think this\n\nis happening? And how can we solve this problem?\n\nScore this IELTS Task 2 essay according to the rubric, ensuring alignment with the question:\n\nIt is clear that, across the world, food wastage is a common phenomenon. There are multiple causes for this problem; and this is not something that can be solved in a single day. A collective effort is required, both from government and citizens to compact this issue. In this essay, I will explore some of the causes for food wastage and propose possible solutions. \n\nFirstly, In a country like India we do not have proper storage facilities and distribution channels for storing perishable items. As a result, vegetables like onions and tomatoes, which have very low shelf life is being wasted or thrown away. To illustrate this point, it has been estimated that every year close to Rs. 100 million worth of vegetable and fruits are rotting away, due to the lack of proper storage infrastructure. It is important for the government to do a thorough study of the distribution channels for these perishable items and come up with a plan to build facilities to store such items at proper locations across the country.\n\nFurthermore, every citizen in our country should take responsibility to prevent food wastage at his/her home.

This essay attempts to shed light on both perspectives before concluding I am favour of the former notion.\n\nOn the one hand, it is understandable why graduates tend to be workers after graduating from high school could be advantageous to  a certain extent. First and foremost, a variety of young people making this decision could become more mature and independent. For example, students who are not good at academic learning might want to make money as soon as possible, which could help them easily pay for various costs of living, such as accommodation, food, and bills, without depending on their families. Furthermore, individuals who work early are very likely to become business owners. This is because they could have more time to gain experience and cultivate relevant job skills, such as communication, teamwork, or problem-solving ability, thereby allowing them to be able to run their own companies.\n\nOn the other hand, there are a host of compelling reasons as to why I am convinced that various elements affect pupils studying further. One reason is that this choice guarantees a bright future. For instance, in Vietnam, the only way to become professional employees, such as doctors, lawyers, or engineers, who often achieve a decent salary and are respected by all walks of life, is to have certificates that prove their qualifications. Another reason is that bachelor's degree holders could be more advantageous in finding a well-earned position in an immensely competitive market. In fact, employers in major corporations, such as Google or Apple, often prioritize recruiting applicants with a bachelor's degree, so that university graduates are more likely to successfully apply to these companies.\n\nIn conclusion, while it is irrefutable that pursuing a career path from an early age creates opportunities to have a successful career path, I would contend that taking part in a university or college is more beneficial.\n\nProvide your assessment in the specified JSON format."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"per_criterion\": [{\"name\": \"Task Response\", \"band\": 8.0, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"Several people propose that having a higher education is the most effective way to pursue a thriving occupation, whereas others assert that entering the workforce right after high school is a better option\", \"This is because they could have more time to gain experience and cultivate relevant job skills, such as communication, teamwork, or problem-solving ability, thereby allowing them to be able to run their own companies\", \"In conclusion, while it is irrefutable that pursuing a career path from an early age creates opportunities to have a successful career path, I would contend that taking part in a university or college is more beneficial\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"Several people propose that having a higher education is the most effective way to pursue a thriving\", \"type\": \"task\", \"fix\": \"Consider improving the task response aspect here.\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Develop your main arguments more fully with specific examples.\", \"Ensure you address all parts of the question directly.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Coherence & Cohesion\", \"band\": 7.0, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"Several people propose that having a higher education is the most effective way to pursue a thriving occupation, whereas others assert that entering the workforce right after high school is a better option\", \"This is because they could have more time to gain experience and cultivate relevant job skills, such as communication, teamwork, or problem-solving ability, thereby allowing them to be able to run their own companies\", \"In conclusion, while it is irrefutable that pursuing a career path from an early age creates opportunities to have a successful career path, I would contend that taking part in a university or college is more beneficial\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"Several people propose that having a higher education is the most effective way to pursue a thriving\", \"type\": \"coherence\", \"fix\": \"Consider improving the coherence & cohesion aspect here.\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Use more varied linking words to connect your ideas.\", \"Improve paragraph structure with clearer topic sentences.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Lexical Resource\", \"band\": 7.0, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"Several people propose that having a higher education is the most effective way to pursue a thriving occupation, whereas others assert that entering the workforce right after high school is a better option\", \"This is because they could have more time to gain experience and cultivate relevant job skills, such as communication, teamwork, or problem-solving ability, thereby allowing them to be able to run their own companies\", \"In conclusion, while it is irrefutable that pursuing a career path from an early age creates opportunities to have a successful career path, I would contend that taking part in a university or college is more beneficial\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"Several people propose that having a higher education is the most effective way to pursue a thriving\", \"type\": \"lexical\", \"fix\": \"Consider improving the lexical resource aspect here.\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Use more sophisticated vocabulary and avoid repetition.\", \"Focus on precise word choice and natural collocations.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Grammatical Range & Accuracy\", \"band\": 8.0, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"Several people propose that having a higher education is the most effective way to pursue a thriving occupation, whereas others assert that entering the workforce right after high school is a better option\", \"This is because they could have more time to gain experience and cultivate relevant job skills, such as communication, teamwork, or problem-solving ability, thereby allowing them to be able to run their own companies\", \"In conclusion, while it is irrefutable that pursuing a career path from an early age creates opportunities to have a successful career path, I would contend that taking part in a university or college is more beneficial\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"Several people propose that having a higher education is the most effective way to pursue a thriving\", \"type\": \"grammar\", \"fix\": \"Consider improving the grammatical range & accuracy aspect here.\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Use more complex sentence structures.\", \"Check for grammatical errors and improve accuracy.\"]}], \"overall\": 7.5}"}]}

In my opinion, this is a matter of debate in light of different factors before any conclusion can be drawn. \r\n\r\nThere are various compelling reasons why teenagers should spend their leisure time doing unpaid work for the community. To begin with, this is a great opportunity for them to gain some practical working experience. Through these kinds of activities, they may face certain challenges which would help sharpen their soft skills and widen their horizons as well as having a multi-dimensional view when evaluating and tackling the problems. For example, in some developed countries such as America or Australia, teenagers will take part in some church activities including cleaning, decorating for special occasions and giving a hand in some team works. That would help them enhance their problem-solving skills and the ability to work with each other as a team. Another noteworthy benefit that should be taken into consideration is that when contributing to society, those juveniles will learn how to love and share with people around them leading to a healthy mind and a friendly society. \r\n\r\nOn the other hand, teenagers should enjoy their free time in the ways they want. As for most of the parts they are fully occupied with their hectic schedules at school, so it is unfair to ask them to work without pay. They have the right to hang out with their friends or play sports to blow off some steam and achieve great physical and mental development. Provided that fact that they join in the community work without payment, they will get exhausted and that might affect their daily routine, and in the worst-case scenario, that would have a negative influence on their academic performance. For instance, in some cultures, teenagers have to spend their holidays working for the pagodas or temples from 4.30 in the morning until 7.30 in the evening and they have to go to bed at 8 o’clock. Although this is a truly meaningful activity, it severely impacts their biological time and makes them feel extremely tired after the holidays. \r\n\r\nIn conclusion, while some have voiced support that juveniles should take part in community work without payment in their leisure time, I would argue that it is better to let them enjoy the time in the ways they want.\n\nProvide your assessment in the specified JSON format."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"per_criterion\": [{\"name\": \"Task Response\", \"band\": 8.5, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"Some have voiced support that juveniles should contribute to the community by taking part in unpaid work in their leisure time as it is greatly beneficial for both themselves and society\", \"On the other hand, teenagers should enjoy their free time in the ways they want\", \"In conclusion, while some have voiced support that juveniles should take part in community work without payment in their leisure time, I would argue that it is better to let them enjoy the time in the ways they want\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"Some have voiced support that juveniles should contribute to the community by taking part in unpaid \", \"type\": \"task\", \"fix\": \"Consider improving the task response aspect here.\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Develop your main arguments more fully with specific examples.\", \"Ensure you address all parts of the question directly.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Coherence & Cohesion\", \"band\": 7.5, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"Some have voiced support that juveniles should contribute to the community by taking part in unpaid work in their leisure time as it is greatly beneficial for both themselves and society\", \"On the other hand, teenagers should enjoy their free time in the ways they want\", \"In conclusion, while some have voiced support that juveniles should take part in community work without payment in their leisure time, I would argue that it is better to let them enjoy the time in the ways they want\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"Some have voiced support that juveniles should contribute to the community by taking part in unpaid \", \"type\": \"coherence\", \"fix\": \"Consider improving the coherence & cohesion aspect here.\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Use more varied linking words to connect your ideas.\", \"Improve paragraph structure with clearer topic sentences.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Lexical Resource\", \"band\": 7.5, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"Some have voiced support that juveniles should contribute to the community by taking part in unpaid work in their leisure time as it is greatly beneficial for both themselves and society\", \"On the other hand, teenagers should enjoy their free time in the ways they want\", \"In conclusion, while some have voiced support that juveniles should take part in community work without payment in their leisure time, I would argue that it is better to let them enjoy the time in the ways they want\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"Some have voiced support that juveniles should contribute to the community by taking part in unpaid \", \"type\": \"lexical\", \"fix\": \"Consider improving the lexical resource aspect here.\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Use more sophisticated vocabulary and avoid repetition.\", \"Focus on precise word choice and natural collocations.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Grammatical Range & Accuracy\", \"band\": 8.5, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"Some have voiced support that juveniles should contribute to the community by taking part in unpaid work in their leisure time as it is greatly beneficial for both themselves and society\", \"On the other hand, teenagers should enjoy their free time in the ways they want\", \"In conclusion, while some have voiced support that juveniles should take part in community work without payment in their leisure time, I would argue that it is better to let them enjoy the time in the ways they want\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"Some have voiced support that juveniles should contribute to the community by taking part in unpaid \", \"type\": \"grammar\", \"fix\": \"Consider improving the grammatical range & accuracy aspect here.\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Use more complex sentence structures.\", \"Check for grammatical errors and improve accuracy.\"]}], \"overall\": 8.0}"}]}

Whereas, school won't gives this space for the same. This essay will substantiate both views in my opine in the following paragraphs with relevant examples.\n\nFirstly, employment is necessary for every student where an university plays a crucial role for  providing a wide range of opportunities to all the graduates. It allows placements from different companies that gives graduates to improve their skills and help them in getting jobs. Moreover, it encourage students in acquring the practical knowledge and indulge them in field projects where they expose themselves to real world and be confident face the society. For example, students who graduated from college working in reputated company because they have skills and ability to learn in their job. Thus, studying at college help young people in shaping their career.\n\nOn the other hand, some people think students should start employment once they completed  their schooling. Despite having less practical knowledge, students work out of enthusiasm. This provides them to grasp the knowledge as their mind acts on high pace. Furthermore, they start earning at their early age if they start working right after school, which helps them to be independent. According to the recent survey, a girl working in an industry who just completed matriculation, support her family with her income.\n\nTo conclude, although employment after schooling is interesting, studying at college always essential to mold a student career in achieving their desired jobs.

This essay outline actions that can be taken in order to fix it up.\n\n \n\nIt is believed that officials could influence on a a lot of process in the cities. And one of them is encouraging people to move countryside. For instance, in year 2001 town Bakersfield in USA was experiencing dramatic growth. Subsequently,it invoked some unpleasant consequences. So local authorities decided to adjust it by encouraging people to move in a villages. They started used all possible methods to involve people. And one of them is using social media to inform people as for all benefits living in village. Additionally,they came up with idea to provides convenient way to get job from village. In results,near 15 percentage of local population moved countries.\n\nReturning again to job question, governments of the country should provide more vacancy suggestions in the rural areas, as more than 90 percentage of people moved to metropolis just for getting a well-paid job. It would be nice to mention latest poll conducted by authorities of the Maharashtra province demonstrated that near 35 percentage of youths don’t wanna live in a large city,but forced to do that, due to luck of job suggestions. \n\nSo, If job opportunities increased,people would be more willing to move countryside.\n\nHowever ,it should be mentioned, that citizens and builders also play an important role in solving this problem. They could help authorities by doing at least something like invest more in building skyscrapers and flats. Apartment usually require less space on the land, whereas, bungalows require it more. \n\nTo summarise, there are some  possible ways to deal with lack of housing is encouraging people to move countryside and provides more job opportunities there.

In my opinion, the international community is undoubtedly responsible for taking instant actions regarding worldwide fossil fuels consumption.\r\n\r\nIt is my view that climate change, which is the current main issue around the world, is especially caused by excessive fossil fuels consumption. Burning fossil fuels emits carbon dioxide which is a potent greenhouse gas and can easily result in a rising temperature. Therefore, extreme weather events and heat waves become inevitable. For instance, with a rising temperature, there would be a loss of biodiversity, destruction of food resources and risks to human well-being and health.

I do not find this argument as convincing as it appears to overlook the fact that reducing fossil fuels consumption not only cuts down carbon emissions but also creates greater job opportunities. For example, there would be an increasing demand for workforces in nuclear power plants construction as well as vacancies in factories that manufacture solar panels.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, I completely agree that the international community needs to take action instantly because all species from humans to plants and animals are seriously at risk.\"\n\nProvide your assessment in the specified JSON format."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"per_criterion\": [{\"name\": \"Task Response\", \"band\": 6.5, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"\\\"It is essential for the global community to monitor whether each country cuts down the use of fossil fuels such as gas and oil as soon as possible\", \"This problematic issue needs to be taken into consideration immediately and globally to be overcome\", \"In conclusion, I completely agree that the international community needs to take action instantly because all species from humans to plants and animals are seriously at risk\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"\\\"It is essential for the global community to monitor whether each country cuts down the use of fossi\", \"type\": \"task\", \"fix\": \"Consider improving the task response aspect here.\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Develop your main arguments more fully with specific examples.\", \"Ensure you address all parts of the question directly.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Coherence & Cohesion\", \"band\": 5.5, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"\\\"It is essential for the global community to monitor whether each country cuts down the use of fossil fuels such as gas and oil as soon as possible\", \"This problematic issue needs to be taken into consideration immediately and globally to be overcome\", \"In conclusion, I completely agree that the international community needs to take action instantly because all species from humans to plants and animals are seriously at risk\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"\\\"It is essential for the global community to monitor whether each country cuts down the use of fossi\", \"type\": \"coherence\", \"fix\": \"Consider improving the coherence & cohesion aspect here.\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Use more varied linking words to connect your ideas.\", \"Improve paragraph structure with clearer topic sentences.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Lexical Resource\", \"band\": 5.5, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"\\\"It is essential for the global community to monitor whether each country cuts down the use of fossil fuels such as gas and oil as soon as possible\", \"This problematic issue needs to be taken into consideration immediately and globally to be overcome\", \"In conclusion, I completely agree that the international community needs to take action instantly because all species from humans to plants and animals are seriously at risk\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"\\\"It is essential for the global community to monitor whether each country cuts down the use of fossi\", \"type\": \"lexical\", \"fix\": \"Consider improving the lexical resource aspect here.\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Use more sophisticated vocabulary and avoid repetition.\", \"Focus on precise word choice and natural collocations.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Grammatical Range & Accuracy\", \"band\": 6.5, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"\\\"It is essential for the global community to monitor whether each country cuts down the use of fossil fuels such as gas and oil as soon as possible\", \"This problematic issue needs to be taken into consideration immediately and globally to be overcome\", \"In conclusion, I completely agree that the international community needs to take action instantly because all species from humans to plants and animals are seriously at risk\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"\\\"It is essential for the global community to monitor whether each country cuts down the use of fossi\", \"type\": \"grammar\", \"fix\": \"Consider improving the grammatical range & accuracy aspect here.\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Use more complex sentence structures.\", \"Check for grammatical errors and improve accuracy.\"]}], \"overall\": 6.0}"}]}

It also affects the children in not knowing the preferences of other genders in different situations, such as \r\n\r\nnot being aware of being a little gentle and well-behaved while talking to a female .

They don’t have the time or patience to wait. Right now, right here is the motto. I attribute this change in attitude to the development in technology, especially internet and mobile technology and, in my opinion, it can be positive and negative at the same time.\n\nNo other technology has had a greater impact on our lives than the internet technology. To say that the internet revolutionized our lives is an understatement. It has made it possible for us to perform just about anything with a few clicks of a button. It allows us to book tickets online, buy things and pay bills anytime and from anywhere. Gone are the days when we had to stand in a long queue to buy railway tickets or pay utility bills. All of those mundane tasks can now be performed within a few seconds. The biggest advantage of the internet is that we can carry it around because it works on a variety of devices of all sizes and shapes. Obviously, it is quite normal for a generation that grew up using the internet from their childhood to want to get everything done in seconds.\n\nHowever, this insistence on getting instant support or response can be positive or negative depending upon our access to technology. The internet has certainly made our lives comfortable and faster. It has allowed us to save a lot time. However, like any other technology, the internet technology can also fail us from time to time. Connection speeds vary from place to place. Also, the reliability is not the same throughout the day. It is not uncommon for people addicted to instant gratification to panic when they lose connectivity. This is a common problem when city people visit rural areas where the internet is either slow or inaccessible.\n\nTo conclude, if the present generation wants to get everything done instantly, that is because they grew up using the internet technology.

Some believe that buying other countrie's agricultural  goods providing more benefits, while others opine that people should support their local farmer's goods instead of imported. I agree with a latter opinion and this essay shall discuss it briefly for the following reasons. \r\n\r\nOn the one hand, people should purchase their domestic food products rather than foreign goods because they should be supported to their local farmers unlikely any corporate companies that to make many profits by this. For instance, when the public consumes other nation's food stuffs while price of the agricultural products might be risen tremendously due to including the  imported tax and travel expenses. In addition, this trend might be continue in future many farmers could be lost their employment along with the agricultural land will be substitued by companies and enterprises, as an consequence, air pollution will be increased and some pesticites will be also eliminated. Therefore, consuming the local farmer's product might be helped their livelihood development. \r\n\r\nOn the other hand, importing food products bring more positive effects to society. Many nations have unlimited resources to cultivate crops and food items but some nations do not have that while this import system help to fulfill their market demands. For example, in Taiwan is an itensive island with unlimited resources, they import many crops to the USA to satisfy their market demands. Furthermore, it will help to balance the food supply around the world and every people can get food equally without any food scarcity. Therefore, importing the agricultural goods provide the positive effect to society. \r\n\r\nTo conclude, although importing food products can satisfy to other countries food item's demand as well as can be balanced the food supply, food products price can be increased by the import tax and travel expense as well as consuming the local agricultural items might be improved the local farmer's livlihood.

Many people believe there is nothing wrong with this action, but there is a significant portion of the population who think otherwise. This essay will argue why I believe the advantages about people having children at later age outweigh disadvantages in the following paragraph.\r\n\r\nFirstly, there are many advantages to having children at a later age. To begin with, the most important family is ready to care for the children. Some parents think kids should be born when everything is enough for them such as money, education and love. Another, the further have a child when the elder have wealth such as house and cars. This is because the family prepared everything for the children.

The traditional classroom setting of a teacher instructing a group of students may be considered outdated by the year 2050. While I agree that the role of teachers and students in the classroom may change, I believe that the traditional teaching situation will still exist to some extent.\r\n\r\nOn the one hand, technology has already begun to revolutionize the way we learn. Online education, for example, has become increasingly popular and has allowed individuals to access educational resources from anywhere in the world. In addition, virtual classrooms and video conferencing have made it possible for students and teachers to connect and communicate without the need for a physical classroom. Furthermore, the use of artificial intelligence and machine learning has also impacted the way we learn. These technologies can personalize learning experiences for each individual, allowing students to work at their own pace and receive customized feedback. This has the potential to transform traditional teaching methods and create a more individualized approach to education.\r\n\r\nHowever, I do not believe that the typical teaching situation will completely disappear. While technology has its benefits, there are certain aspects of learning that require face-to-face interaction. The physical presence of a teacher in the classroom can be invaluable, as it provides students with the opportunity to ask questions, receive immediate feedback, and engage in group discussions. The classroom environment also promotes socialization and collaboration, which are essential skills for students to develop. Moreover, the traditional teaching situation provides a sense of structure and routine that can be beneficial for students. The physical classroom creates a learning space where students can focus and eliminate distractions. It also establishes a routine for students, which can help them develop good study habits and time management skills.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, while the teaching situation in the year 2050 may be different from what we know today, I believe that the traditional classroom setting will still exist to some extent. While technology may transform the way we learn, the physical presence of a teacher and the classroom environment provide benefits that cannot be replaced by digital tools.

Do you think this is a positive or negative development?\n\nScore this IELTS Task 2 essay according to the rubric, ensuring alignment with the question:\n\nIt is true that in this technological era, traditional courses provided by higher educational institutes have been replaced by electronic learning courses. While this trend of teaching raises some issues, I feel that these online courses have great benefits for learners as well as tutors.\r\n\r\nOn the one hand, the introduction of technology in the education sector brings some concerns. Firstly, e-learning can be a hindrance in the development of learners’ soft skills like teamwork, collaboration etc., which always play a crucial role in the overall development of an individual and due to lack of interaction with instructor and classmates, students are unable to develop such abilities. Secondly, it affects the academic performance of pupils as they tend to procrastinate because there is no monitoring authority on them which also sometimes results in poor allocation of time to complete assignments. Finally, plagiarism and dishonesty are also areas of concern in which students get themselves involved while studying online owing to which they try to implement some unauthorized use of technology like indulging in transgression that may drive them to the verge of being expelled from the course of study.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, this change is advantageous in many aspects. The first and foremost factor is accessibility which scholars have achieved with the advent of computer-based courses since distance barriers can be erased by the adoption of video-conferencing technology as it saves precious travelling time and students in destitute regions are now more likely to approach higher academic subjects as compared to the past. Moreover, flexibility and convenience are the other benefits that a person can get with the help of virtual classes as any learner can study without time restriction and scholars can avail high quality education by prominent professors from renowned universities via e-learning. Last but not least, online distance education enables the students to review lectures and discussions and provides them with the opportunity to repeat any lecture if they are not able to understand the concepts, thus giving them the laxity to study without any extra charges from the tutor.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, no doubt this change is criticized due to having some adverse effects on scholars, I believe that its above-mentioned benefits cannot be neglected.\n\nProvide your assessment in the specified JSON format."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"per_criterion\": [{\"name\": \"Coherence & Cohesion\", \"band\": 6.5, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"It is true that in this technological era, traditional courses provided by higher educational institutes have been replaced by electronic learning courses\", \"Finally, plagiarism and dishonesty are also areas of concern in which students get themselves involved while studying online owing to which they try to implement some unauthorized use of technology like indulging in transgression that may drive them to the verge of being expelled from the course of study\", \"In conclusion, no doubt this change is criticized due to having some adverse effects on scholars, I believe that its above-mentioned benefits cannot be neglected\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"It is true that in this technological era, traditional courses provided by higher educational instit\", \"type\": \"coherence\", \"fix\": \"Consider improving the coherence & cohesion aspect here.\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Use more varied linking words to connect your ideas.\", \"Improve paragraph structure with clearer topic sentences.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Task Response\", \"band\": 7.0, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"It is true that in this technological era, traditional courses provided by higher educational institutes have been replaced by electronic learning courses\", \"Finally, plagiarism and dishonesty are also areas of concern in which students get themselves involved while studying online owing to which they try to implement some unauthorized use of technology like indulging in transgression that may drive them to the verge of being expelled from the course of study\", \"In conclusion, no doubt this change is criticized due to having some adverse effects on scholars, I believe that its above-mentioned benefits cannot be neglected\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"It is true that in this technological era, traditional courses provided by higher educational instit\", \"type\": \"task\", \"fix\": \"Consider improving the task response aspect here.\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Develop your main arguments more fully with specific examples.\", \"Ensure you address all parts of the question directly.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Lexical Resource\", \"band\": 6.0, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"It is true that in this technological era, traditional courses provided by higher educational institutes have been replaced by electronic learning courses\", \"Finally, plagiarism and dishonesty are also areas of concern in which students get themselves involved while studying online owing to which they try to implement some unauthorized use of technology like indulging in transgression that may drive them to the verge of being expelled from the course of study\", \"In conclusion, no doubt this change is criticized due to having some adverse effects on scholars, I believe that its above-mentioned benefits cannot be neglected\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"It is true that in this technological era, traditional courses provided by higher educational instit\", \"type\": \"lexical\", \"fix\": \"Consider improving the lexical resource aspect here.\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Use more sophisticated vocabulary and avoid repetition.\", \"Focus on precise word choice and natural collocations.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Grammatical Range & Accuracy\", \"band\": 6.0, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"It is true that in this technological era, traditional courses provided by higher educational institutes have been replaced by electronic learning courses\", \"Finally, plagiarism and dishonesty are also areas of concern in which students get themselves involved while studying online owing to which they try to implement some unauthorized use of technology like indulging in transgression that may drive them to the verge of being expelled from the course of study\", \"In conclusion, no doubt this change is criticized due to having some adverse effects on scholars, I believe that its above-mentioned benefits cannot be neglected\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"It is true that in this technological era, traditional courses provided by higher educational instit\", \"type\": \"grammar\", \"fix\": \"Consider improving the grammatical range & accuracy aspect here.\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Use more complex sentence structures.\", \"Check for grammatical errors and improve accuracy.\"]}], \"overall\": 6.5}"}]}

Discuss both views and give your own opinion.\n\nScore this IELTS Task 2 essay according to the rubric, ensuring alignment with the question:\n\nIn the globalized society, the issue of increasing business and cultural communication worldwide has sparked considerable debate. Some argue that increasing communication among countries fosters development both in personal and professional settings. On the contrary, others contend that exposure to the culture of other countries too much will greatly negatively affect the acknowledgement of domestic history and culture. This essay will delve into both views deeply \r\n\r\nProponents hold the view that emphasizing on communication worldwide positively cultivates the development at individual, entreprise and country level. At the individual level, worldwide information exchange and multiple languages communication improve the ability of critical thinking and academical learning. At the enterprise level, the popular trend of international trade and international companies provide more employment opportunities domestically. Moreover, GDP of one country will also be fostered by increasing economic benefits of importation and exportation.\r\n\r\nConversely, some assert that the history and culture of the native country tend to be easily forgotten by the invasion of the exterior culture. For example, along with the increasing exposure to western culture, most young adults are more likely to celebrate Christmas instead of some Chinese traditional festival. The history of the original of Dragon festival has been forgotten by increasingly younger population.\r\n\r\nIn my opinion, while the acknowledgment of domestic culture and identity is paramount, I highly agree that the positive side of increasing culture and business contacts worldwide prioritizes the downside. In the business setting, strengthening international communication will provide domestic industries more opportunities to step out of the country and build long-term strategic relationships with other partners abroad, maintaining sustainable development in the national economy. Secondly, encouraging cultural communication not only helps people learn more about exterior culture but also builds bridges to let foreigners know more about their own culture. It is indispensable to highlight the importance of propagating domestic culture properly through public education rather than limiting the chance to communicate worldwide to avoid the erosion of exterior culture.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, while increasing communication in business and culture setting has some negative effect in the acknowledgment of national identity so far, the positive effect outperforms its downside by improving the personal and country delopment under correct guidance.\n\nProvide your assessment in the specified JSON format."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"per_criterion\": [{\"name\": \"Task Response\", \"band\": 5.5, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"In the globalized society, the issue of increasing business and cultural communication worldwide has sparked considerable debate\", \"Conversely, some assert that the history and culture of the native country tend to be easily forgotten by the invasion of the exterior culture\", \"In conclusion, while increasing communication in business and culture setting has some negative effect in the acknowledgment of national identity so far, the positive effect outperforms its downside by improving the personal and country delopment under correct guidance\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"In the globalized society, the issue of increasing business and cultural communication worldwide has\", \"type\": \"task\", \"fix\": \"Consider improving the task response aspect here.\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Develop your main arguments more fully with specific examples.\", \"Ensure you address all parts of the question directly.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Coherence & Cohesion\", \"band\": 4.5, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"In the globalized society, the issue of increasing business and cultural communication worldwide has sparked considerable debate\", \"Conversely, some assert that the history and culture of the native country tend to be easily forgotten by the invasion of the exterior culture\", \"In conclusion, while increasing communication in business and culture setting has some negative effect in the acknowledgment of national identity so far, the positive effect outperforms its downside by improving the personal and country delopment under correct guidance\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"In the globalized society, the issue of increasing business and cultural communication worldwide has\", \"type\": \"coherence\", \"fix\": \"Consider improving the coherence & cohesion aspect here.\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Use more varied linking words to connect your ideas.\", \"Improve paragraph structure with clearer topic sentences.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Lexical Resource\", \"band\": 4.5, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"In the globalized society, the issue of increasing business and cultural communication worldwide has sparked considerable debate\", \"Conversely, some assert that the history and culture of the native country tend to be easily forgotten by the invasion of the exterior culture\", \"In conclusion, while increasing communication in business and culture setting has some negative effect in the acknowledgment of national identity so far, the positive effect outperforms its downside by improving the personal and country delopment under correct guidance\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"In the globalized society, the issue of increasing business and cultural communication worldwide has\", \"type\": \"lexical\", \"fix\": \"Consider improving the lexical resource aspect here.\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Use more sophisticated vocabulary and avoid repetition.\", \"Focus on precise word choice and natural collocations.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Grammatical Range & Accuracy\", \"band\": 5.5, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"In the globalized society, the issue of increasing business and cultural communication worldwide has sparked considerable debate\", \"Conversely, some assert that the history and culture of the native country tend to be easily forgotten by the invasion of the exterior culture\", \"In conclusion, while increasing communication in business and culture setting has some negative effect in the acknowledgment of national identity so far, the positive effect outperforms its downside by improving the personal and country delopment under correct guidance\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"In the globalized society, the issue of increasing business and cultural communication worldwide has\", \"type\": \"grammar\", \"fix\": \"Consider improving the grammatical range & accuracy aspect here.\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Use more complex sentence structures.\", \"Check for grammatical errors and improve accuracy.\"]}], \"overall\": 5.0}"}]}

There is an argument that says that a lot of stuff that has been taught for children is such a waste of time! However, others believe that studying at these institutions is helpful and meaningful at some point. In my point of view, I agree that these places are really useful. In the following paragraphs, I will discuss both sides and support my opinion.\r\n\r\nTo begin with, the reasons behind believing that institutions like kindergarten, primary and elementary faculty are useless because the way that the educational environment limits and kills the children creativity and intelligence. For instance, there is an international kindergarten in my city, and my friend has a son who studied at it she thought they  used a terrible method of teaching young children, which is studying from 8 a.m. to 1 p.m. and just 15 minutes for playing, and there is a mid-term and flint test. She believes that her son was excited and smart before. That’s why she thinks  kindergarten was a bad idea and her child was suffering. \r\n\r\nIn contrast, people argue that the educational society ,for example, nurseries, kindergartens, primary and elementary schools have many advantages. First, it sharpens the child’s mind and improves the skills of thinking. Like they are studying math, so they can count. Second, it helps to build a relationship with peers and become social hence, he will be friendly, kind, respectful and cooperative. Moreover, solving the problems, she/he will depend on her/home self such as tie his shoes, wear his coat and go to the bathroom. A recent study shows that  COVID-19 time records a significant increase in the number of children who become less creative and social  because they spent two years studying at home. They lost their ability to communicate with their mates and become more violent. Finally, teachers play  role models in children’s lives. When you ask a child who is his teacher in nursery school? Most of them will answer the question and confirm that these instructors were a reason for being successful. My orphan uncle, who lost his parents early, and felt lonely, his hair was messy and wore a dirty uniform. But his teacher was kind and merciful. She was his second mother and encouraged him. Now my uncle is one of the greatest doctors because of her.\r\n\r\nTo conclude, while some people think that schools have a negative impact on young individuals.

From my standpoint, the better the sports conveniences where, the better the public health there. \n    It has been proven that people can improve health of themselves without sports facilities. For instance, they can be much healthier if they avoid eating too much junk food. If he or she is inclined to eat meals that are  rich in vitamins or go to the doctor's on a regular basis with the aim of increasing his or her condition, they definitely manage to do it irrespective of what sport facilities created by governments.

In that case, despite what conditions, authorities create in order to ameliorate the health of people, they turn out to be less efficient. \n   However, no sooner do authorities constitute sports facilities, then they will reap benefits from them. Above all, inhabitants provided with enough conditions to do sports activities can improve their fitness. Clearly indicating, locals, especially youngsters who are dynamic and energetic are not enabled to join in sports centres if special conveniences are not available in the area where they live in, as a result, they become deprived of making profits from conveniences supplied. Thus, a lack of opportunities may appear as an obstacle to have a healthy lifestyle.

Therefore, there has been so much discussion revolving around the issue of whether government ought to concentrate on improving these issues to contribute to reducing the rate of human beings who are suffering from illness. The reasons why I partially agree will  be provided in this essay.\r\n\r\nTo begin with, I opine that these complicated harmful problems will be only solved by administrations and they have potential effects on us. As our planet is becoming more toxic, a variety of unheard diseases have been identified in the modern society. Not only that, houses in urban areas are tuning into more sacrifice presences because a multitude of citizens want to move to these areas. If we have to escape from these phenomenons, the only thing we are able to rely is the authority. For instance, executives can increase the number of jobs in the countrysides to prevent housing crisis. In addition, they have power to control or limit the overwhelming use of chemical substances. That is why I cannot disagree with the statement.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, individuals should put effort and energy to keep themselves from diseases as well. These troubles are not only related to environments but also a considerable number of factors exist. Among them, personal lifestyles have the most major effect. For example, a person who has consumed loads of stimulatively sugary or salty food is more likely to have diabetes and heart disease than a human who has had meals healthily  according to the study. Thus, I totally believe that every single person's trying is needed as well.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, I admit that the administration's control has to be involved to advance the places where we live in as it is the only institute that is holding a key.

In my opinion, I strongly disagree with this statement. This essay will provide what I believe.\r\n\r\nAlthough schooling is equal to the certificate, it is not necessarily related to how successful their lives will be. Some successful celebrities did not graduate from the traditional education system. Take Steve Jobs as a sample. He had the biggest business model, Apple, because he knew how to utilize his knowledge as well as his creativity at the optimal moment. Also, he was renewed because of his persistence in learning habits, reading, and self-regulation, which he learned at school rather than his degree. Therefore, students benefit from schools not only by being loyal citizens and qualified staff in our society but also in their personal successful life experiences later.\r\n\r\nMoreover, students should adapt to living in this society with their peers at school, such as how to survive in daily life and how to socialize with classmates. Otherwise, they can be self-educated at home rather than schooling. In my country, there are increasing numbers of course providers which teach students about survival, such as cooking in the wild, doing domestic duty, and training the high communication skills. Learning cookery and domestic cleaning can allow pupils to grow up quickly and take after themselves without others’ assistance. Also, the well-established communication skills can offer positive effects on learners’ lives no matter at work or in their daily lives. Again, education providers offer merits not only on students’ character and career but on their happiness.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, school students do not only learn about being good citizens and being successful professional persons, but also educators should look after setting up their personal happiness simultaneously.\n\nProvide your assessment in the specified JSON format."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"per_criterion\": [{\"name\": \"Task Response\", \"band\": 7.5, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"There is no doubt that education plays an imperative role in shaping pupils’ manners as good persons and developing their competencies for their careers, instead of offering benefits for each pupils’ happiness\", \"Therefore, students benefit from schools not only by being loyal citizens and qualified staff in our society but also in their personal successful life experiences later\", \"In conclusion, school students do not only learn about being good citizens and being successful professional persons, but also educators should look after setting up their personal happiness simultaneously\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"There is no doubt that education plays an imperative role in shaping pupils’ manners as good persons\", \"type\": \"task\", \"fix\": \"Consider improving the task response aspect here.\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Develop your main arguments more fully with specific examples.\", \"Ensure you address all parts of the question directly.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Coherence & Cohesion\", \"band\": 6.5, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"There is no doubt that education plays an imperative role in shaping pupils’ manners as good persons and developing their competencies for their careers, instead of offering benefits for each pupils’ happiness\", \"Therefore, students benefit from schools not only by being loyal citizens and qualified staff in our society but also in their personal successful life experiences later\", \"In conclusion, school students do not only learn about being good citizens and being successful professional persons, but also educators should look after setting up their personal happiness simultaneously\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"There is no doubt that education plays an imperative role in shaping pupils’ manners as good persons\", \"type\": \"coherence\", \"fix\": \"Consider improving the coherence & cohesion aspect here.\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Use more varied linking words to connect your ideas.\", \"Improve paragraph structure with clearer topic sentences.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Lexical Resource\", \"band\": 6.5, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"There is no doubt that education plays an imperative role in shaping pupils’ manners as good persons and developing their competencies for their careers, instead of offering benefits for each pupils’ happiness\", \"Therefore, students benefit from schools not only by being loyal citizens and qualified staff in our society but also in their personal successful life experiences later\", \"In conclusion, school students do not only learn about being good citizens and being successful professional persons, but also educators should look after setting up their personal happiness simultaneously\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"There is no doubt that education plays an imperative role in shaping pupils’ manners as good persons\", \"type\": \"lexical\", \"fix\": \"Consider improving the lexical resource aspect here.\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Use more sophisticated vocabulary and avoid repetition.\", \"Focus on precise word choice and natural collocations.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Grammatical Range & Accuracy\", \"band\": 7.5, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"There is no doubt that education plays an imperative role in shaping pupils’ manners as good persons and developing their competencies for their careers, instead of offering benefits for each pupils’ happiness\", \"Therefore, students benefit from schools not only by being loyal citizens and qualified staff in our society but also in their personal successful life experiences later\", \"In conclusion, school students do not only learn about being good citizens and being successful professional persons, but also educators should look after setting up their personal happiness simultaneously\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"There is no doubt that education plays an imperative role in shaping pupils’ manners as good persons\", \"type\": \"grammar\", \"fix\": \"Consider improving the grammatical range & accuracy aspect here.\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Use more complex sentence structures.\", \"Check for grammatical errors and improve accuracy.\"]}], \"overall\": 7.0}"}]}

Increasing in the global population and people becoming more prosperous are two main causes of this issue. This essay will not only discuss about those root causes, but it will also introduce some solutions to tackle the problem. \n\nFirstly, the increase in the world population, especially in the developing countries such as India and China, is a main reason for the growth of the goods consumption. For example, the more citizens using papers, the more tree being cut in order to produe papers. Additionally, the demand of people who are richer than the past is increasing also, for example, the rich citizens can own multiple high-end cell phone or another electric device like iPad or laptops. Consequently, the consumer goods are being produced much more than ever to meet the demand from the countries. \n\nRegarding solutions, there are two ways that the government can take it into consideration to eliminate the issue. Firstly, educating people to have simple living is one of the good ways that the authority should consider, for instance, introducing a simple living style in Japan and its benefit in the online channels. Furthermore, the government should invest more money in the recycling systems, such as paper, water, electric device recycling systems. Those systems definitely help to reduce using the natural resources like wood to produce paper. \n\nIn conclusion, the global population increasing and the demand from the rich people also growing are the main factors for the problem.

This is due to major distractions such as social media and the high volume of stress in their life. Proper counselling and guidance can resolve these issues.\r\n\r\nFirstly, we have to focus on the reason for the distractions in students' life. The excessive use of social media and more  dedication towards virtual images takes a lot of time and effort, hence minimizing the focus on education. Taking the example of Apple reports, children aged 12-16 years use mobile phones approximately 8 to 12 hours per day.\r\n\r\nThe second reason can be contributed to the high stress in students' lifestyles. Students nowadays are facing huge competition in terms of career and life. Taking a real-life example, a class 5th student is expected to choose subjects based on his future career. Most of the students end up taking subjects under peer pressure. This result in slowly losing interest in studies and ending up frustrated and disturbed. \r\n\r\nFurthermore, steps should be taken to acknowledge these problems. Students should be educated on the disadvantages of using social media. They should be counselled on what subjects to be chosen on basis of interests. Overall every student is unique and should be approached in a different manner.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, the purpose of education is to  impart knowledge in such a manner that children can actually learn the greater purpose of life, that is education is a bridge to achieving something bigger in life.

The economic sector determines the overall quality of life, ensuring the basic sector such as schools, hospitals and roads are available to all the citizens irrespective of their income and social status. Public services are the primary needs of  society and thus need proper funding. \n\nFor example, the absence of medicine in any country will create significant problems. That's why the authority should adequately finance  public services in the first place. Becoming old is a normal thing for everyone however younger citizens participate an important role in the country's economic growth.\n\nOn the other hand, retired adults are a vital part of every family. Who encourage their close ones  as well as provide their experiences. I think adults must save their funds during their working years. However old people also are an integrated part of  society. Some ancient could save their money but most of the old society could not save money because of high expenses. I think the regime should provide free medicines and treatments for low-income citizens.\n\nFor instance, Sri Lanka provides free hospital   treatments for people.\n\nIn conclusion, after a thorough analysis of the topic, I believe the ministry should allocate its budget for argent needs.\n\nHowever old population are also a crucial unit of  society.

People are discussing  the climate change more often than ever. Currently, the earth temperature is increasing by more than 3 degrees on an annual basis due to shifts in weather. To keep a check on this rapid temperature change, governments and organisations across the globe are putting in cummulative efforts. While this change has brought a concern to authorities, it has proven to be advantageous for many corporates in many business aspects.\r\n\r\nFirst and foremost,  this climate change has added an extra burden on the finances of many global companies. Many corporates have been increasing their amount of Corporate Social Responsibility(CSR) towards this climate change. For instance, in recent report by Financial Times, companies have increased their CSR index amount to an average of 3%, which was earlier 1%. Furthermore, this change has clearly disrupted the demand-supply chain for companies. As more and more people are concerned about the environment, they are shifting towards the usage of eco-friendly products. People are avoiding buying new automobiles, Air conditioners, Refrigerators nowadays and this is, in turn, has increased the supply more than its demand, which creates a loss for many companies. Clearly, climate change has shown a detrimental effect on many businesses.\r\n\r\nHowever, this adjustment has provided ample opportunities for many start-ups. Many communities are actively contributing to the cause to heal the planet.

Machines have taken over jobs earlier done by humans. This essay shall discuss the advantages and disadvantages of Machines taking over human effort. Machines have taken over the world by storm.  Allthough Machine Revolution has some disadvantages, it can be said that machine revolution has made it easier to live our lives. \r\n\r\nIndustrial revolution gave birth to the rise of Machine Revolution. The first machine that was created was the Spinning Jenny which was employed in the textile factory where it helped in the mass production of cloth in factory. Later on, the creation of the diesel engine made it easier to transport materials and passengers from place to another. Hence the machines brought about economic prosperity to their owners since they could monitered and profits could be made which could help a nation prosper.\r\n\r\nHowever, it is said that a coin has an opposite side. It is true that Machines brought a lot of ease in the working of human civilization but it also brought its own set of problems. The Spinning Jenny for example was extremly unpopular amongst the village women because it took their source of income and destroyed cottage industries through which villages survived. Many young children and women are exploited by undergoing long strenous working hours just to moniter these machines with less or no pay. Many scientists  argue that in the future machines would destroy humans as shown in the famous movie the Terminator wherein an Artificial Intelligence named Skynet, takes over the planet and wages a human - machine war.\r\n\r\n To conclude, I believe that there is no doubt machines are the wonders of the world. They have made lives easier and they also instill fear that they would at some point take over the world.

Discuss both views.\n\nScore this IELTS Task 2 essay according to the rubric, ensuring alignment with the question:\n\nAt the turn of the 21st century, there is a growing debate about whether it is a better way for young people to continue their studies in tertiary education such as college or university or to start their employment life early after they finish high school in order to become successful. While there are benefits of working after school, there are also good reasons why students should carry on their higher education.\n\nOn the one hand, there are advantages of schooling at a higher level when compared to early employment life. First of all, young people can gain experience of working together with a team to complete the whole project. It is a great opportunity to improve their ability before they start their working life. As a result, when they commence their career life, they will definitely know how to communicate with other people from different organizations and how to handle problems among people that may help them to get their good performance. Another benefit from this is a better foundation is received from experience ones who will lecture at university which may help to get a higher salary. For instance, they have more potential to apply in working life what they studied from higher education which may lead to obtaining employer's impressive. \n\nOn the other hand, working straight after school is magnificent for several reasons. Young people can obtain their own money to expend monthly allowances and support to family when they are in need which will make sure less burden on parents. As a matter of fact, they become independent and mature people although they are young. Moreover, they will have enough experience than the one who is going to study in college or university at the same age. As a consequence, it is an attractive way for employers who look for a better experience and good progress in working. It will help them to reach a successful career path as soon as possible. \n\nTo conclude , there are own advantages for both working right after school and joining higher education before the workforce.

This essay disagrees with this statement because individuals are taught to protect the world and investigations are done first.\r\n\r\nThe main reason for this is that there is an increasing concern about protecting the planet. So people in their own country, at schools, looking at the news and in other ways are taught about how important is to protect the place where they live. So they have in their mind what they should do and what not, and destroying the environment is one thing that they cannot do. Recent research concluded that in Germany although there are a large number of tourists every month  there is almost no trash on the floors, and there is not  increase in contamination and global warming even with the huge amount of visitors. \r\n\r\nAnother reason is that when people decide to travel to other countries will look for information about that place. Normally the internet has lots of  information about the culture of the nation and if there is something that individuals should really consider, it can be easily found on the internet. Also, when people decide to visit somewhere  because they like those places, then they are willing to follow those cultures if needed.

To what extent do you agree or disagree?\n\nScore this IELTS Task 2 essay according to the rubric, ensuring alignment with the question:\n\nOne school of thought holds that most of one’s success is attributable to a stroke of luck. While I accept that this perception is somewhat justifiable, I disagree that people can be successful without hard work and consistency.\r\n\r\nIt would be imprudent to downplay the role of luck in achieving one’s goals. Although not concretely helping individuals achieve their aims, luck has a colossal impact on their possibility of becoming a successful person. For example, if Kobe Bryant had been born in the same period of time with Michael Jordan, it would have been much more difficult for him to become the best player of the NBA of his time because he would have had to compete with a person who may be better than him at their best, making it more challenging for him to gain as much as success as he did. This is a powerful testament to the influence of fortune on one’s accomplishment.\r\n\r\nHowever, I am of the opinion that prosperity only can be earned by those who are determined and industrious due to a host of compelling reasons. One rationale is that success requires a plethora of high-valued skills, which can only be attained through a process of hard working.

While there are some benefits to students getting a job straight, I believe that keep going to university or college is the best path to finding a satisfying career. In this essay, I will explain both sides in detail in the ensuing paragraphs.\n\nAdolescents getting a career directly after high school is attractive for several reasons. Firstly, a university degree is not necessary for some industries. In Taiwan, for example, there are a few managers for service professions who assume practical training is more important. In addition, these youth would gain more work experience, become more independent, and even start earning money sooner than other peers who are students.\n\nOn the other hand, I completely agree that it is more beneficial to young people for continuing their programs at university. The major reason is a degree can open the door to better employment prospects. For instance, most jobs, such as medical professions or engineering require academic qualifications, including specific knowledge and skills. Moreover, schools aim to teach teenagers moral values such as tolerance and sharing, which prepare them to be members of society.  Therefore, once graduating from college or higher degree, they get better job opportunities, earn higher salaries, and also contribute positively to society. These indicate that higher education indeed brings some positive effects on people.\n\nIn conclusion, despite the fact that there are some advantages to going to work straight after school, it seems to me that getting a higher education is more likely to have better competitiveness in the job market.\n\nProvide your assessment in the specified JSON format."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"per_criterion\": [{\"name\": \"Task Response\", \"band\": 8.0, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"It is true that teenagers face the dilemma of whether to work or continue their education after school\", \"On the other hand, I completely agree that it is more beneficial to young people for continuing their programs at university\", \"In conclusion, despite the fact that there are some advantages to going to work straight after school, it seems to me that getting a higher education is more likely to have better competitiveness in the job market\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"It is true that teenagers face the dilemma of whether to work or continue their education after scho\", \"type\": \"task\", \"fix\": \"Consider improving the task response aspect here.\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Develop your main arguments more fully with specific examples.\", \"Ensure you address all parts of the question directly.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Coherence & Cohesion\", \"band\": 7.0, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"It is true that teenagers face the dilemma of whether to work or continue their education after school\", \"On the other hand, I completely agree that it is more beneficial to young people for continuing their programs at university\", \"In conclusion, despite the fact that there are some advantages to going to work straight after school, it seems to me that getting a higher education is more likely to have better competitiveness in the job market\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"It is true that teenagers face the dilemma of whether to work or continue their education after scho\", \"type\": \"coherence\", \"fix\": \"Consider improving the coherence & cohesion aspect here.\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Use more varied linking words to connect your ideas.\", \"Improve paragraph structure with clearer topic sentences.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Lexical Resource\", \"band\": 7.0, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"It is true that teenagers face the dilemma of whether to work or continue their education after school\", \"On the other hand, I completely agree that it is more beneficial to young people for continuing their programs at university\", \"In conclusion, despite the fact that there are some advantages to going to work straight after school, it seems to me that getting a higher education is more likely to have better competitiveness in the job market\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"It is true that teenagers face the dilemma of whether to work or continue their education after scho\", \"type\": \"lexical\", \"fix\": \"Consider improving the lexical resource aspect here.\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Use more sophisticated vocabulary and avoid repetition.\", \"Focus on precise word choice and natural collocations.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Grammatical Range & Accuracy\", \"band\": 8.0, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"It is true that teenagers face the dilemma of whether to work or continue their education after school\", \"On the other hand, I completely agree that it is more beneficial to young people for continuing their programs at university\", \"In conclusion, despite the fact that there are some advantages to going to work straight after school, it seems to me that getting a higher education is more likely to have better competitiveness in the job market\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"It is true that teenagers face the dilemma of whether to work or continue their education after scho\", \"type\": \"grammar\", \"fix\": \"Consider improving the grammatical range & accuracy aspect here.\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Use more complex sentence structures.\", \"Check for grammatical errors and improve accuracy.\"]}], \"overall\": 7.5}"}]}

Generally speaking, I consider this phenomenon a recognition and respect for  family bonds and I suggest they search the Internet to find out what they need.\r\n\r\nIt is no doubt that the education methods and legendary stories handed over by generations have a strong impact on elderly people. Therefore, the place their ancestors lived in —where they designed norms and illustrated stories—has also been regarded and treasured as a symbol of  family spirits and merits.

To what extent do you agree or disagree?\n\nScore this IELTS Task 2 essay according to the rubric, ensuring alignment with the question:\n\nIt is considered by some that the news is not related to people's livelihood and that is why it does not deserve the attention  to read or watch them. In my opinion, it is really questionable if one should acquire such a type of knowledge or not. This essay will discuss both sides.\r\n\r\nOn the one hand,processing the news can lead to overloading our brains with useless information. For example, an average citizen has no need to heat the information about wars, conflicts, weather catastrophics, etc. happening in other countries, if it is only not linked with his or her own region. Moreover,to my view, it only distracts the mind and puts a watcher into an anxious mood. My parents watch television news every evening and learn nothing from them but some rubbish facts which are undoubtedly important for other continents but not for Russia, the place where they live.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the information linked with the area where person lives becomes crucial in some sort of situation.

Survey conducted by Child health development unit of Cambridge University reported that, television is considered to be the major factor behind the development of an introvert personality among individuals at their early age.

Thus, time spent sitting behind screen influence the child's general nature at macro level.\n\nHowever the content shown have rather more detrimental effects on adolescents ; influencing there mental health. Content displayed generally constitutes violence, adultery and use of abusive language. Psychologists says that, children usually become what they see visually. Visual inputs are believed to have long lasting impact on Human Psychology. Statistics prove that children watching violence on television become more violent by nature on the other hand , those who watch comedy programs develops humorous behaviour . Hence, what is seen constantly, have impacts on child's mentality and impacts natural way of expression  .\n\nTo conclude, in my opinion the time duration does influence the behaviour of adolescents but it is actually the content  seen that decides and control children  behavioural characteristics at long run and good behaviour can be promoted  by effective parenting.\n\nProvide your assessment in the specified JSON format."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"per_criterion\": [{\"name\": \"Task Response\", \"band\": 5.5, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"Childhood is most tender age, which is considered to be greatly influenced by external factors\", \"Thus, time spent sitting behind screen influence the child's general nature at macro level\", \"To conclude, in my opinion the time duration does influence the behaviour of adolescents but it is actually the content  seen that decides and control children  behavioural characteristics at long run and good behaviour can be promoted  by effective parenting\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"Childhood is most tender age, which is considered to be greatly influenced by external factors\", \"type\": \"task\", \"fix\": \"Consider improving the task response aspect here.\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Develop your main arguments more fully with specific examples.\", \"Ensure you address all parts of the question directly.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Coherence & Cohesion\", \"band\": 4.5, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"Childhood is most tender age, which is considered to be greatly influenced by external factors\", \"Thus, time spent sitting behind screen influence the child's general nature at macro level\", \"To conclude, in my opinion the time duration does influence the behaviour of adolescents but it is actually the content  seen that decides and control children  behavioural characteristics at long run and good behaviour can be promoted  by effective parenting\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"Childhood is most tender age, which is considered to be greatly influenced by external factors\", \"type\": \"coherence\", \"fix\": \"Consider improving the coherence & cohesion aspect here.\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Use more varied linking words to connect your ideas.\", \"Improve paragraph structure with clearer topic sentences.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Lexical Resource\", \"band\": 4.5, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"Childhood is most tender age, which is considered to be greatly influenced by external factors\", \"Thus, time spent sitting behind screen influence the child's general nature at macro level\", \"To conclude, in my opinion the time duration does influence the behaviour of adolescents but it is actually the content  seen that decides and control children  behavioural characteristics at long run and good behaviour can be promoted  by effective parenting\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"Childhood is most tender age, which is considered to be greatly influenced by external factors\", \"type\": \"lexical\", \"fix\": \"Consider improving the lexical resource aspect here.\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Use more sophisticated vocabulary and avoid repetition.\", \"Focus on precise word choice and natural collocations.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Grammatical Range & Accuracy\", \"band\": 5.5, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"Childhood is most tender age, which is considered to be greatly influenced by external factors\", \"Thus, time spent sitting behind screen influence the child's general nature at macro level\", \"To conclude, in my opinion the time duration does influence the behaviour of adolescents but it is actually the content  seen that decides and control children  behavioural characteristics at long run and good behaviour can be promoted  by effective parenting\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"Childhood is most tender age, which is considered to be greatly influenced by external factors\", \"type\": \"grammar\", \"fix\": \"Consider improving the grammatical range & accuracy aspect here.\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Use more complex sentence structures.\", \"Check for grammatical errors and improve accuracy.\"]}], \"overall\": 5.0}"}]}

This would be beneficial for both adolescents and local residents. I agree with this notion that it is necessary to engage them in voluntary work. This essay will discuss the positive aspects with examples. \n\nTo embark with, youngsters will be able to  comprehend their responsibility towards the society if they do unpaid work. Because when they interact with other members of the group then they come to realize the problems associated with different issues like education, poverty, pollution and many more. Moreover, they could arrange awareness campaigns in towns ,which disseminates information about different sources of income.Child Welfare Scheme, for example, has revealed that many poor families have been helped by school students by supporting them in agricultural tasks. As a result, volunteering makes students the most responsible citizens of the country. \n\nMoreover, unrewarded work helps the teenagers in shaping their character. As they learn how to communicate and handle difficult situations.

There are several reasons for that. First and foremost, it leads to excessive spending of money resulting in financial instability of a person.For instance, a person spends much more than his capacity for latest trends just to show-off in the society and satisfy his ego.Secondly, it leads to wastage of crucial time which would have been utilized in a much better way otherwise.To add on, it is quite common for people to spend hours searching for clothes in-line with the latest styles on various e-commerce websites.Thirdly, going after fresh crazes distracts students from their studies and they spend their valuable time following the latest trends.Moreover, they get carried away by the glamorous lifestyle of various celebrities.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, some people hold a different opinion.First of all, good styling helps an individual to stand apart from the crowd.Additionally, increased self-confidence helps one to succeed in various aspects of life.Second of all, following the fresh trends makes a person aware of global styles.Also, it enhances the personality of an individual, making him a well informed citizen.\r\n\r\nTo conclude, although there are enormous positive effects of fashion.

While some people assume that it is of the tremendous benefit of investing in encouraging national competitors to participate in international competitions, others think that it is of importance to allocate money to children to attend sports. From my point of view, both children and professional athletes should receive an equal investment.\n\nOn the one hand, having attendants at cross-bordered competitions can have great impacts on a country’s economy. Since these games are held worldwide, which means they have influences on a mass scale, by gaining triumph, the image of them as well as the country they represent is dispersed widely among people from all over the world, attracting a wealth of foreign investors.

Therefore, it is of the essence to have citizens, who are on behalf of their country, taking part in international sports contests.  \n\nOn the other hand, the government should also concentrate on developing sports internal infrastructures to draw more teenagers playing sports as it is crucial for the growth of a nation. Since children in this digital age spend 5-6 hours a day on watching tv, they are prone to suffer from some diseases such as cancers, which deters them from fully joint labour markets in the future and can become a burden for society.

However, some people think that the government should spend more money on education for the adult population who cannot read and write. To what extent do you agree or disagree?\n\nScore this IELTS Task 2 essay according to the rubric, ensuring alignment with the question:\n\nIn recent years, whether education for the young is vital in nations has sparked much debate. Some people assert that countries should mainly focus on people from a young age, whereas others argue that the government should allocate more money to educating the adult group who do not have the ability to read and write. From my perspective, I strongly believe that money should be spent on helping illiterate adults to learn.\n\nOn the one hand, it is undoubtedly vital to focus on educating children from a young age since it will provide opportunities for the youth to develop their fundamental knowledge, therefore decreasing the number of illiterate citizens in the future. Furthermore, education in schools has been the main priority in multiple nations throughout the past few decades to enhance the country’s workforce. For example, in Vietnam, the government spends billions of dollars, which is nearly 10% of the country’s GDP, on the education field each year with the purpose of funding the young generation, therefore developing the economy in the future. \n\nOn the other hand, countries deciding to invest in millennials who do not know how to write and read will reap financial rewards. This is because the investment will bring a better-educated workforce, thus fostering the growth of the economy and the country’s development. With the main concentration on illiterate adults, the corollary of this would be a sustainable economy and a better society. Moreover, since adults who are not capable of reading or writing often have tremendous difficulties in social and professional life, literacy courses will provide them with the necessary knowledge to overcome such problems. For instance, participants of these classes will no longer feel helpless when they need to read a piece of story to their children before going to bed or write an email to their friends. Ultimately, they will not be deprived of promotion opportunities solely on their basis of literacy skills, or the lack thereof.\n\nIn conclusion, although this is still a multifaceted problem that we have to be more considerable in the near future, I strongly believe that giving access to education to illiterate adults should be adapted more widely, therefore developing the country’s economy more efficiently.\n\nProvide your assessment in the specified JSON format."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"per_criterion\": [{\"name\": \"Coherence & Cohesion\", \"band\": 6.0, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"In recent years, whether education for the young is vital in nations has sparked much debate\", \"On the other hand, countries deciding to invest in millennials who do not know how to write and read will reap financial rewards\", \"In conclusion, although this is still a multifaceted problem that we have to be more considerable in the near future, I strongly believe that giving access to education to illiterate adults should be adapted more widely, therefore developing the country’s economy more efficiently\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"In recent years, whether education for the young is vital in nations has sparked much debate\", \"type\": \"coherence\", \"fix\": \"Consider improving the coherence & cohesion aspect here.\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Use more varied linking words to connect your ideas.\", \"Improve paragraph structure with clearer topic sentences.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Task Response\", \"band\": 6.5, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"In recent years, whether education for the young is vital in nations has sparked much debate\", \"On the other hand, countries deciding to invest in millennials who do not know how to write and read will reap financial rewards\", \"In conclusion, although this is still a multifaceted problem that we have to be more considerable in the near future, I strongly believe that giving access to education to illiterate adults should be adapted more widely, therefore developing the country’s economy more efficiently\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"In recent years, whether education for the young is vital in nations has sparked much debate\", \"type\": \"task\", \"fix\": \"Consider improving the task response aspect here.\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Develop your main arguments more fully with specific examples.\", \"Ensure you address all parts of the question directly.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Lexical Resource\", \"band\": 5.5, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"In recent years, whether education for the young is vital in nations has sparked much debate\", \"On the other hand, countries deciding to invest in millennials who do not know how to write and read will reap financial rewards\", \"In conclusion, although this is still a multifaceted problem that we have to be more considerable in the near future, I strongly believe that giving access to education to illiterate adults should be adapted more widely, therefore developing the country’s economy more efficiently\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"In recent years, whether education for the young is vital in nations has sparked much debate\", \"type\": \"lexical\", \"fix\": \"Consider improving the lexical resource aspect here.\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Use more sophisticated vocabulary and avoid repetition.\", \"Focus on precise word choice and natural collocations.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Grammatical Range & Accuracy\", \"band\": 5.5, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"In recent years, whether education for the young is vital in nations has sparked much debate\", \"On the other hand, countries deciding to invest in millennials who do not know how to write and read will reap financial rewards\", \"In conclusion, although this is still a multifaceted problem that we have to be more considerable in the near future, I strongly believe that giving access to education to illiterate adults should be adapted more widely, therefore developing the country’s economy more efficiently\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"In recent years, whether education for the young is vital in nations has sparked much debate\", \"type\": \"grammar\", \"fix\": \"Consider improving the grammatical range & accuracy aspect here.\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Use more complex sentence structures.\", \"Check for grammatical errors and improve accuracy.\"]}], \"overall\": 6.0}"}]}

I will briefly elaborate on both views.\nTo begin with, the museums are being visited by the millions of art fans in the modern life. The fans are spending their leisure time in order to observe the piece of arts and ruins. The major target is controversial whether they should be full of joy. For instance, Anatolian Museum, which is in my city, celebrates European Museum Day every 18th May. They ask for some artist and students to tell the stories. Therefore, both of the enjoyment and information is shown and reflected to the special day guests. Due to, if they learnt their cultural heritage, they would be aware of importance of all ages, all humanity. \nOn the other hand, some individuals have just merged to amuse in the museums. They do not care about history. However, they can adjust to the contemporary art galleries. When the people tend to the these types of activities, they can change to a better person who is indulgent, open-minded, intelligent. For instance, a local science-fiction conseptional ones are initiated in these days, particularly for the youth. Not only to join a part of the conventional museum, also modern galleries can be developed because the minority of the citizens is interested in only future based ones.

Many experts contend that over the next 10 years, robots will take over the jobs in many industries, which are currently done by people. To my way of thinking, there are both pros and cons to this proposal in equal measure. \r\n\r\nThere are many advantages, if you ask me, to this situation. In the first place, it increases work productivity at the workplace. Machines can work much longer hours than human employees without taking breaks. Their result is much more efficient and far more accurate than employees. People may make mistakes at work, but machines do not. Added to this, they do not have to be paid. Some occasional repairs are may be required over the long periods.  This saves a great amount of money for businesses. For instance, many supermarkets in many countries use automatic customer check-out points, which avoid hiring many workers. \r\n\r\nBe that as it may, the downsides of this phenomenon, if you ask me, are just as big. For one thing, it raises the unemployment rate. People who lose jobs because of this will have no income and therefore no money to spend. This could cause serious consequences for the economy. To name but one example, governments cannot get taxes from individuals. As a result of this, governments do not have enough funds for schools, hospitals, public transport and many other facilities and infrastructure. It follows to stand, therefore, that the quality of all essential services will suffer. \r\n\r\nTurning to my own experience, the way things are when it comes to this issue in my country, China, is the same as it was across the world over. My home city of Shanghai is a classic case in point. Here, many factories use robots to make products. Many workers cannot find jobs due to the higher preferences for machines in industrial sectors. \r\n\r\nAt the end of the day, there are merits and drawbacks to all choices we make in life. It is very important that governments play a role in creating enough employment opportunities for humans.

I personally agree partly with this view. \r\n\r\nOn the one hand, one’s life may benefit from the appearance of several multinational organizations. To begin with, a greater number of global companies means people have great chances in order to make a living because there will be a position for them in the company. Besides, one may have to communicate and meet lots of people when working in a global organization, which means they will have a clear opportunity to widen their social circle. Moreover, customers might receive magnificent customer service from many multinational companies. Companies located in countries means they have an enormous number of customers. This means they have to put effort into enhancing their customer service. As a result, one could experience outstanding service from these companies. \r\n\r\nOn the other hand, negative effects could be the result of multinational organizations. Firstly, it is extremely hard for those who want to create their own business because they have to compete with lots of big companies. For example, start-ups in Vietnam have to undergo difficulties because they have to face several big worldwide organizations. Besides, customers often tend to choose well-known companies such as worldwide companies and newly-created companies might not become their option. Secondly, being fluent in several languages could be one of the requirements for those who want to have a job in a multinational company. This means those who are just able to communicate in their mother tongue cannot work for a global company and this may tighten their opportunities in order to get a job. \r\n\r\nIn conclusion, the huge number of global companies results in lots of benefits for people such as creating jobs for them or giving them significant customer assistance.

I partially agree with this statement, due to the fact that both arguments have beneficial and negative affect on society.\r\n\r\n   On the one hand, in  developed countries importing products without controlling and putting some diminution by the government might lead to poor quality items.

Eventually, there are put some restrictions on the seller in order to keep stable economic growth.   \r\n\r\n   On the other hand, there are numerous benefits to people on free trade on import. Firstly, new business starters who start with a small amount of budget cannot follow  government restrictions. For example, exporting cotton had prohibited in Uzbekistan. As a result, year by year growing cotton has been going down because demand is low and price also is minimal.\r\n\r\nSecondly, doing monopoly in local trade is easier by putting restrictions.

To what extent do you think are consumers influenced by advertisements? What measures can be taken to protect them?\n\nScore this IELTS Task 2 essay according to the rubric, ensuring alignment with the question:\n\nLiving in a century that is influenced materialistically, we are inundated with an array of advertisements. In my opinion, the excess practice of it, whether on TV, internet or print media, could be menacing as it invigorates people to spend more without thinking cautiously. Hence, there should be some protective measures to avert over-spending. In the following essays, I shall discuss this in detail.\n\nTo begin with, compelling advertising, showcasing attractive products and services, forces people to spend even when it is not necessary. In the present scenario, companies with massive budgets have adopted varying methods to advertise their offering, ranging from TV commercials to flyers in newspaper that it is becoming strenuous for people to escape from these activities. For instance, if you are watching a cricket match, it is very likely that you will come across logos or advertisements of sponsors. Similarly, if you are watching a web series or a movie, you will find a promotional product. At the very least, even if you are just scrolling through social media in your free time, you will find hoards of advertisements or influencers promoting products. This volume of advertising simply means that we, as consumers, are profoundly cajoled into purchasing such products without giving them enough thought.\n\nAs far as the regulation is concerned, it is not a piece of cake to decide how the advertisements can be regulated. Evidently, governments have to restrict advertisements for such products that could pose health threats or are harmful, such as tobacco, alcohol, and more. Considering that the government doesn’t have significant control over other advertising forms, consumers will have to use their common sense. This includes brainstorming over the need of a product than giving up in front of the desires or wants. Waiting for 24-hours before buying a product can help as well. This means not scrolling through products on the internet mindlessly or not giving in to the temptation of buying the latest smartphone.\n\nIn the end, it could be concluded that while it is difficult to escape entirely from advertisements and their effects, people should control their urges to purchase anything unnecessarily.\n\nProvide your assessment in the specified JSON format."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"per_criterion\": [{\"name\": \"Task Response\", \"band\": 5.0, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"Living in a century that is influenced materialistically, we are inundated with an array of advertisements\", \"At the very least, even if you are just scrolling through social media in your free time, you will find hoards of advertisements or influencers promoting products\", \"In the end, it could be concluded that while it is difficult to escape entirely from advertisements and their effects, people should control their urges to purchase anything unnecessarily\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"Living in a century that is influenced materialistically, we are inundated with an array of advertis\", \"type\": \"task\", \"fix\": \"Consider improving the task response aspect here.\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Develop your main arguments more fully with specific examples.\", \"Ensure you address all parts of the question directly.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Coherence & Cohesion\", \"band\": 4.0, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"Living in a century that is influenced materialistically, we are inundated with an array of advertisements\", \"At the very least, even if you are just scrolling through social media in your free time, you will find hoards of advertisements or influencers promoting products\", \"In the end, it could be concluded that while it is difficult to escape entirely from advertisements and their effects, people should control their urges to purchase anything unnecessarily\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"Living in a century that is influenced materialistically, we are inundated with an array of advertis\", \"type\": \"coherence\", \"fix\": \"Consider improving the coherence & cohesion aspect here.\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Use more varied linking words to connect your ideas.\", \"Improve paragraph structure with clearer topic sentences.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Lexical Resource\", \"band\": 4.0, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"Living in a century that is influenced materialistically, we are inundated with an array of advertisements\", \"At the very least, even if you are just scrolling through social media in your free time, you will find hoards of advertisements or influencers promoting products\", \"In the end, it could be concluded that while it is difficult to escape entirely from advertisements and their effects, people should control their urges to purchase anything unnecessarily\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"Living in a century that is influenced materialistically, we are inundated with an array of advertis\", \"type\": \"lexical\", \"fix\": \"Consider improving the lexical resource aspect here.\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Use more sophisticated vocabulary and avoid repetition.\", \"Focus on precise word choice and natural collocations.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Grammatical Range & Accuracy\", \"band\": 5.0, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"Living in a century that is influenced materialistically, we are inundated with an array of advertisements\", \"At the very least, even if you are just scrolling through social media in your free time, you will find hoards of advertisements or influencers promoting products\", \"In the end, it could be concluded that while it is difficult to escape entirely from advertisements and their effects, people should control their urges to purchase anything unnecessarily\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"Living in a century that is influenced materialistically, we are inundated with an array of advertis\", \"type\": \"grammar\", \"fix\": \"Consider improving the grammatical range & accuracy aspect here.\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Use more complex sentence structures.\", \"Check for grammatical errors and improve accuracy.\"]}], \"overall\": 4.5}"}]}

Some people stated that a rise in cost of fuel is the only way to improve this problem. From my perspective, increasing in petrol price may be reasonable to some extent; however, this solution remains several drawbacks.\r\n\r\nOn the one hand, setting a higher cost for fuel will be beneficial in some aspects of alleviating severe pollution problems nowadays. Firstly, the rate of air pollution will improve significantly as the amount of carbon emission decreases. Since people are restricted to traveling by vehicles, they would commute on foot or by bicycles more often, which, in turn, reduces a considerable amount of carbon footprint released per day. Secondly, the solution also assists in preventing the dramatic degradation of renewable resources. As less fuel is consumed, the frequency of exploitation of natural resources will gradually lessen over time, allowing them to renew faster. \r\n\r\nOn the other hand, there will doubtlessly occurs some problems when establishing fuel price escalation. It is evident that the decline in petrol consumption will result in a loss of profit for petroleum industry. As the number of fuel consumers decreases, it will be a daunting task for companies to maintain due to the lack of operating expenditure; some may even undergo bankruptcy. Moreover, higher costs of fuel may bring about shrinkage in daily expenses for people, especially those who accommodate in rural areas. Consequently, they will have to cut down on the money spared for other basic needs; hence, their life standard may be negatively impacted.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, concerns on the surrounding environment can be mitigated by increasing price of petrol; nevertheless, some existing disadvantages should be taken into great consideration for the sake of a balance society.\n\nProvide your assessment in the specified JSON format."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"per_criterion\": [{\"name\": \"Task Response\", \"band\": 6.0, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"In recent decades, environmental issues has never failed to draw public’s attention\", \"As less fuel is consumed, the frequency of exploitation of natural resources will gradually lessen over time, allowing them to renew faster\", \"In conclusion, concerns on the surrounding environment can be mitigated by increasing price of petrol; nevertheless, some existing disadvantages should be taken into great consideration for the sake of a balance society\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"In recent decades, environmental issues has never failed to draw public’s attention\", \"type\": \"task\", \"fix\": \"Consider improving the task response aspect here.\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Develop your main arguments more fully with specific examples.\", \"Ensure you address all parts of the question directly.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Coherence & Cohesion\", \"band\": 5.0, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"In recent decades, environmental issues has never failed to draw public’s attention\", \"As less fuel is consumed, the frequency of exploitation of natural resources will gradually lessen over time, allowing them to renew faster\", \"In conclusion, concerns on the surrounding environment can be mitigated by increasing price of petrol; nevertheless, some existing disadvantages should be taken into great consideration for the sake of a balance society\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"In recent decades, environmental issues has never failed to draw public’s attention\", \"type\": \"coherence\", \"fix\": \"Consider improving the coherence & cohesion aspect here.\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Use more varied linking words to connect your ideas.\", \"Improve paragraph structure with clearer topic sentences.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Lexical Resource\", \"band\": 5.0, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"In recent decades, environmental issues has never failed to draw public’s attention\", \"As less fuel is consumed, the frequency of exploitation of natural resources will gradually lessen over time, allowing them to renew faster\", \"In conclusion, concerns on the surrounding environment can be mitigated by increasing price of petrol; nevertheless, some existing disadvantages should be taken into great consideration for the sake of a balance society\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"In recent decades, environmental issues has never failed to draw public’s attention\", \"type\": \"lexical\", \"fix\": \"Consider improving the lexical resource aspect here.\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Use more sophisticated vocabulary and avoid repetition.\", \"Focus on precise word choice and natural collocations.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Grammatical Range & Accuracy\", \"band\": 6.0, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"In recent decades, environmental issues has never failed to draw public’s attention\", \"As less fuel is consumed, the frequency of exploitation of natural resources will gradually lessen over time, allowing them to renew faster\", \"In conclusion, concerns on the surrounding environment can be mitigated by increasing price of petrol; nevertheless, some existing disadvantages should be taken into great consideration for the sake of a balance society\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"In recent decades, environmental issues has never failed to draw public’s attention\", \"type\": \"grammar\", \"fix\": \"Consider improving the grammatical range & accuracy aspect here.\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Use more complex sentence structures.\", \"Check for grammatical errors and improve accuracy.\"]}], \"overall\": 5.5}"}]}

Furthermore , ladies perform their regular household chores manually  , such as mopping the floors , blending spices and cooking food on coals . all the above illustrations clear that  life at an early age was so difficult and people had to do more hard work as compared to the present generation . \r\n\r\nOn the other hand , continuous science research had shadowed all the globe  with its latest advancements and providing feasibility and ease in everyday life, to elaborate, latest and fastest means of transport system make individuals life easy as one can travel without any hassle. Smartphones connect people in a glimpse and easiest mode to receive all the latest news around the world. Along with that, the latest electronic equipment makes lives heaven, for example, vacuums, electric blenders, coffee machines, electric stoves and whatnot. Although, it makes the nation lazy and less physical activity is performed by every individual which raises several health concerns.\r\n\r\nTo conclude , I agree that advanced automation makes everything so easy that you can do anything at your fingertips, however , a person should not depend on these gadgets entirely as this can cause severe health concerns in the long run for future generations. Everyone should balance their routine accordingly and also perform some tasks manually to keep themselves more active.\n\nProvide your assessment in the specified JSON format."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"per_criterion\": [{\"name\": \"Task Response\", \"band\": 7.5, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"Undoubtedly , in this present world life has become more convenient and comfortable due to the advancement of technology\", \"all the above illustrations clear that  life at an early age was so difficult and people had to do more hard work as compared to the present generation\", \"Everyone should balance their routine accordingly and also perform some tasks manually to keep themselves more active\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"Undoubtedly , in this present world life has become more convenient and comfortable due to the advan\", \"type\": \"task\", \"fix\": \"Consider improving the task response aspect here.\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Develop your main arguments more fully with specific examples.\", \"Ensure you address all parts of the question directly.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Coherence & Cohesion\", \"band\": 6.5, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"Undoubtedly , in this present world life has become more convenient and comfortable due to the advancement of technology\", \"all the above illustrations clear that  life at an early age was so difficult and people had to do more hard work as compared to the present generation\", \"Everyone should balance their routine accordingly and also perform some tasks manually to keep themselves more active\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"Undoubtedly , in this present world life has become more convenient and comfortable due to the advan\", \"type\": \"coherence\", \"fix\": \"Consider improving the coherence & cohesion aspect here.\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Use more varied linking words to connect your ideas.\", \"Improve paragraph structure with clearer topic sentences.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Lexical Resource\", \"band\": 6.5, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"Undoubtedly , in this present world life has become more convenient and comfortable due to the advancement of technology\", \"all the above illustrations clear that  life at an early age was so difficult and people had to do more hard work as compared to the present generation\", \"Everyone should balance their routine accordingly and also perform some tasks manually to keep themselves more active\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"Undoubtedly , in this present world life has become more convenient and comfortable due to the advan\", \"type\": \"lexical\", \"fix\": \"Consider improving the lexical resource aspect here.\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Use more sophisticated vocabulary and avoid repetition.\", \"Focus on precise word choice and natural collocations.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Grammatical Range & Accuracy\", \"band\": 7.5, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"Undoubtedly , in this present world life has become more convenient and comfortable due to the advancement of technology\", \"all the above illustrations clear that  life at an early age was so difficult and people had to do more hard work as compared to the present generation\", \"Everyone should balance their routine accordingly and also perform some tasks manually to keep themselves more active\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"Undoubtedly , in this present world life has become more convenient and comfortable due to the advan\", \"type\": \"grammar\", \"fix\": \"Consider improving the grammatical range & accuracy aspect here.\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Use more complex sentence structures.\", \"Check for grammatical errors and improve accuracy.\"]}], \"overall\": 7.0}"}]}

Some people think it has a negative effect on sport in general. To what extent do you agree or disagree.\n\nScore this IELTS Task 2 essay according to the rubric, ensuring alignment with the question:\n\nNowadays, sports are being used by sponsors to launch their new products in the market. According to a group of folks, it is a great matter of concern as it takes away the spirit of the game. I personally disagree with the statement as it attracts a good chunk of money which later can be used for future sports events. \r\n\r\nTo begin with, Money is the biggest factor behind this trend as it is hard to deny the fact that organizing a sporting event takes time and millions of dollars, especially when it comes to an international-level game. Moreover, to get that big amount of money they contact companies that can help them to build big stadiums and hotels for players. After all, players need money for food as well, the government could not simply bear thousands of players across the globe so in that case they ask big firms for help. For instance, Tata Group helped India to organize an Asia Games back in 2010. it took over 3 billion US dollars just to build the big stadiums and tracks for the game.\r\n\r\nIn addition, people who think that it is killing game spirit simply think only from the game perspective as those individuals do not know that the game they are watching on their television is actually backed by a sponsor channel. Moving further, players also get their prize in the form of a cheque. In a favour, all they do is promote their products during events as it helps both the game and the sponsors. For instance, During the Tokyo Olympics, over 2000 companies made a profit worth billions of dollars simply by showcasing their products on TV during breaks.  \r\n\r\nTo conclude, to keep sports alive it is crucial for organizers to ask big companies for help, and in return, they can get their products prompted by influential players, which can help them to make some money.

Others think the parents should be punished instead.\r\n\r\nDiscuss both views and give your own opinion.\n\nScore this IELTS Task 2 essay according to the rubric, ensuring alignment with the question:\n\nThe question of who should assume responsibility concerning crimes committed by the youths has become more and more debatable as some argue that parents should be fully accountable for the incident. In my opinion, while there are some exceptions, most cases merit greater punishment for parents.\r\n\r\nThe most frequently cited rationale against this reform is that parents are not always culpable. There are numerous instances of loving parents who raise their kid well but social problems still manifest from a young age. One of the salient illustrations of this is predominately indicated in the case if a child suffers from a mental illness such as a dissociative disorder. This condition may stem from simple genetics in which case parents should not be punished or trauma that primary caregivers are not aware of. For instance, if they have been abused at school or by a relative then it follows logically the offending, rather than innocent, party should be brought to justice.\r\n\r\nAlbeit I concede the important exceptions that the courts must sort through, I still contend that parental abuse and neglect should be punishable. Studies have elucidated that most young children, who commit crimes, have been abused to some extent by their parents. This can be most apparently seen in serial killers which are an extreme but useful source in point. The majority of serial killers begin antisocial behaviour from a young age including the criminal torture of animals. There is also no evidence of serial killers coming from happy homes or stable upbringings. This has reasoned that parents play a pivotal role in moulding the psyche of the youngsters as there has been a clear and tangible impact on the behaviour induced by them.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, there are some cases where parents are not at fault for criminal acts by their offspring but in most situations, they are the driving force. In my view, governors and educators should propose a more holistic approach in order to tackle this and mitigate further severity.\n\nProvide your assessment in the specified JSON format."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"per_criterion\": [{\"name\": \"Task Response\", \"band\": 7.5, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"The question of who should assume responsibility concerning crimes committed by the youths has become more and more debatable as some argue that parents should be fully accountable for the incident\", \"Albeit I concede the important exceptions that the courts must sort through, I still contend that parental abuse and neglect should be punishable\", \"In my view, governors and educators should propose a more holistic approach in order to tackle this and mitigate further severity\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"The question of who should assume responsibility concerning crimes committed by the youths has becom\", \"type\": \"task\", \"fix\": \"Consider improving the task response aspect here.\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Develop your main arguments more fully with specific examples.\", \"Ensure you address all parts of the question directly.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Coherence & Cohesion\", \"band\": 6.5, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"The question of who should assume responsibility concerning crimes committed by the youths has become more and more debatable as some argue that parents should be fully accountable for the incident\", \"Albeit I concede the important exceptions that the courts must sort through, I still contend that parental abuse and neglect should be punishable\", \"In my view, governors and educators should propose a more holistic approach in order to tackle this and mitigate further severity\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"The question of who should assume responsibility concerning crimes committed by the youths has becom\", \"type\": \"coherence\", \"fix\": \"Consider improving the coherence & cohesion aspect here.\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Use more varied linking words to connect your ideas.\", \"Improve paragraph structure with clearer topic sentences.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Lexical Resource\", \"band\": 6.5, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"The question of who should assume responsibility concerning crimes committed by the youths has become more and more debatable as some argue that parents should be fully accountable for the incident\", \"Albeit I concede the important exceptions that the courts must sort through, I still contend that parental abuse and neglect should be punishable\", \"In my view, governors and educators should propose a more holistic approach in order to tackle this and mitigate further severity\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"The question of who should assume responsibility concerning crimes committed by the youths has becom\", \"type\": \"lexical\", \"fix\": \"Consider improving the lexical resource aspect here.\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Use more sophisticated vocabulary and avoid repetition.\", \"Focus on precise word choice and natural collocations.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Grammatical Range & Accuracy\", \"band\": 7.5, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"The question of who should assume responsibility concerning crimes committed by the youths has become more and more debatable as some argue that parents should be fully accountable for the incident\", \"Albeit I concede the important exceptions that the courts must sort through, I still contend that parental abuse and neglect should be punishable\", \"In my view, governors and educators should propose a more holistic approach in order to tackle this and mitigate further severity\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"The question of who should assume responsibility concerning crimes committed by the youths has becom\", \"type\": \"grammar\", \"fix\": \"Consider improving the grammatical range & accuracy aspect here.\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Use more complex sentence structures.\", \"Check for grammatical errors and improve accuracy.\"]}], \"overall\": 7.0}"}]}

In this essay, I will analyze the perspective before arriving at my final conclusion. \r\n\r\nApparently, there are several reasons why the government should let any country sell goods to other countries. Firstly, it will boost the economic growth of the country; since domestic manufacturers search for many markets which attract citizens from other countries, and some foreign investment as well. As a result, with that impact, the economy of the country can be developed at a high speed. Secondly, without the government limitation, many international companies will have a chance to sell their products which means the average cost of goods will be lower due to no taxes. Consequently, more citizens will be able to buy more affordable goods that can reduce the rate of poverty and hunger.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, there are still certain negative aspects on both citizens and companies when letting this action happen. Initially, people can face the danger of banned substances. To be more specific, if there is no testing or limitation, some bad people will have the opportunity to put harmful substances not only in the food, but also in the products people use everyday. Therefore, consumers will be the victims of these crimes and have to deal with sickness or death. In the second place, there will be competition between local and international business. Since some people who are foreign-favored and now the price of those products is also low, it will be hard for the development of local companies.  \r\n\r\nIn conclusion, I personally disagree with this proposal since it has many negative developments for one country, so it is advisable that the government impose strict control on the goods which are exported and imported.\n\nProvide your assessment in the specified JSON format."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"per_criterion\": [{\"name\": \"Task Response\", \"band\": 4.5, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"It is argued that all nations should have the right to buy and sell goods to different parts of the world without any restriction or interference of the governments\", \"On the other hand, there are still certain negative aspects on both citizens and companies when letting this action happen\", \"In conclusion, I personally disagree with this proposal since it has many negative developments for one country, so it is advisable that the government impose strict control on the goods which are exported and imported\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"It is argued that all nations should have the right to buy and sell goods to different parts of the \", \"type\": \"task\", \"fix\": \"Consider improving the task response aspect here.\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Develop your main arguments more fully with specific examples.\", \"Ensure you address all parts of the question directly.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Coherence & Cohesion\", \"band\": 3.5, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"It is argued that all nations should have the right to buy and sell goods to different parts of the world without any restriction or interference of the governments\", \"On the other hand, there are still certain negative aspects on both citizens and companies when letting this action happen\", \"In conclusion, I personally disagree with this proposal since it has many negative developments for one country, so it is advisable that the government impose strict control on the goods which are exported and imported\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"It is argued that all nations should have the right to buy and sell goods to different parts of the \", \"type\": \"coherence\", \"fix\": \"Consider improving the coherence & cohesion aspect here.\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Use more varied linking words to connect your ideas.\", \"Improve paragraph structure with clearer topic sentences.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Lexical Resource\", \"band\": 3.5, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"It is argued that all nations should have the right to buy and sell goods to different parts of the world without any restriction or interference of the governments\", \"On the other hand, there are still certain negative aspects on both citizens and companies when letting this action happen\", \"In conclusion, I personally disagree with this proposal since it has many negative developments for one country, so it is advisable that the government impose strict control on the goods which are exported and imported\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"It is argued that all nations should have the right to buy and sell goods to different parts of the \", \"type\": \"lexical\", \"fix\": \"Consider improving the lexical resource aspect here.\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Use more sophisticated vocabulary and avoid repetition.\", \"Focus on precise word choice and natural collocations.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Grammatical Range & Accuracy\", \"band\": 4.5, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"It is argued that all nations should have the right to buy and sell goods to different parts of the world without any restriction or interference of the governments\", \"On the other hand, there are still certain negative aspects on both citizens and companies when letting this action happen\", \"In conclusion, I personally disagree with this proposal since it has many negative developments for one country, so it is advisable that the government impose strict control on the goods which are exported and imported\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"It is argued that all nations should have the right to buy and sell goods to different parts of the \", \"type\": \"grammar\", \"fix\": \"Consider improving the grammatical range & accuracy aspect here.\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Use more complex sentence structures.\", \"Check for grammatical errors and improve accuracy.\"]}], \"overall\": 4.0}"}]}

However, I agree with the view that people can still tackle this situation by effective measures.\r\n\r\nIt is argued that some plants and animals cannot be rescued anymore. Urbanization leads to the disappearance of thousands of species in latest one hundred years. This activity destroyed the habitats of various animals, such as crocodiles, bears and tigers. Some species of these animals ever lived in rivers, marshlands and forests which have already been replaced by concrete jungles. Also, trees and plants are demolished from the earth at an incredible speed. The increasing population needs more land to raise domestic animals and grow agricultural plants. As a result, a large number of forests and bushes are burned down and cannot be found in the wild forever.  \r\n\r\nHowever, it has been  common sense that humans should take activities to protect endangered species. In most countries, governments encourage the public to reduce the demand for wood products and impose  higher taxes on these products. This measure can be considered  a great way to control  deforestation. Furthermore, some non-government organizations devote their life to help  forest protection. They organize a variety of programs to educate the public and raise  awareness of the importance of environmental protection. Moreover, some parks and institutions help to raise and feed endangered animals to keep the biodiversity. For example, the panda, one of the Chinese precious animals, has been well-protected by Chinese authority, which has grown up to a large amount and individuals can watch their shows in different zoos and parks in the world.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion，although some plant and animal species already disappeared from the earth, I believe that people can take effective steps to protect them.

There are so many reasons behind this situation and a number of resources are available to find the background history of buildings or houses .\r\n\r\nTo begin with, the two main reasons of receiving the information about the building or house are security and background history of theft or stolen property. As security has become the major reason among people to protect themselves while living in the new area because people want to have more safety. Secondly, background check is must to get the records of the area that if the property was stolen or anything which was dangerous .For instance, sometimes the buildings are owned/sold by other people and they live for so many years and suddenly the real owner might come to take possession of that building. So, checking the past records of building has become very important for people.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, availability of information resources can be taken from police or people living in the neighbour .

There are some who claim that it is important to support  the artists, and others who are opposed to government funding. In the following  paragraphs, I shall discuss both sides of the argument and finally give my opinion.  There are many reasons why government should fund artists. The contributions of  artists to the society are very essential. Art can bring out people’s creativity, views and  personalities. For example, we learn about our history, traditions and culture through  movies, songs and paintings made by artists. Artists are the media of diffusing  tradition. All kinds of tradition are the basis of a country without which the country  can’t be civilised. So artists are the ambassadors of culture and play a vital role in  elevating the level of civilization of the country. It is a major form of cultural  abundance.  Another important aspect of this is that art is an ancient means of communication.  Our language is a result of people’s need to communicate. Art is what differentiates us  from animals. Art is our soul and it is a source of courage. Artists also entertain us.  Finally, government should fund artists because earning a livelihood from art is  difficult especially in the budding stages.  Opponents of government funding on artists say that money spent on the arts could  have been used for considerably more vital purposes. They have strong reasons as a  nation’s health and wellbeing should be paramount. The idea that elderly people are  forced to wait for essential operations whilst the money required to increase available  medical provision is spent on opera and ballet is plainly immoral. There are also more  deserving social causes for the money that should be considered before the arts.

There are several underlying reasons behind this development, such as improper changes in cities, but the problem is manageable.\r\n\r\nThe main reason can be pinpointed towards the infrastructure of cities and the amount of people. Some cities have more people than they can accommodate and this situation also has a negative impact on traffic. So, the traffic problem may not be a priority problem in a city with a small population compared to New York. Since owning a luxury car is considered part of people's prestige and people are addicted to self-comfort, people are encouraged to buy a new car. A second reason why traffic is a huge problem is that the infrastructures of cities are not suitable for the large number of cars. In some cities, the roads are so narrow for vehicles that there is no second option for people to reach their destination. As a result, traffic jams can sometimes stretch to the horizon and people are forced to sit in their cars for hours to reach their homes or workplaces.\r\n\r\nThere is no magic formula to solve the massive traffic problems, but some precautions can be taken to ease the congestion on city roads. One of the most effective ways to solve this problem is to make public transport more attractive to people. For example, the authorities can advertise to people the importance of using transportation or develop the stops of subways, trains or trams. In this way, when people realise that their travel time is reduced, they will be more likely to use public transport. On the other hand, municipalities can introduce various legal restrictions on the number of special vehicles. For example, some people own more than one car, and this number can be reduced to one car. Nevertheless, these measures are not enough to solve the traffic problem completely.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, the traffic problem has become one of the biggest problems in many cities due to the high population. The interesting thing about this problem is that there are plenty of places to live all over the world, but people choose to live in crowded cities.

My essay will outline a number of reasons for this trend and a number of its associated solutions.\n\nTo begin with, the increase in production of consumer products that harm the environment. When more goods are produced, more waste and toxic emissions are released from factories into nature. Water sources are polluted and air is seriously polluted, leading to harmful to humans and the death of many marine and terrestrial animals. For example, in Vietnam, when the Vinh Tan thermal power plant increased its electricity production, it caused extremely serious environmental pollution, affecting surrounding people, and columns of black smoke were continuously released. Therefore, leading to serious air pollution for surrounding people. Meanwhile, growing production of wares will consume a lot of materials. For instance, in a rural area of ​​China, a large number of trees are cut down in the forest to put into factories to produce house construction materials and tools. Consequently, This directly affects the ecological balance and habitat of many animal species.\n\nHowever, there are some possible solutions that can solve this problem. Firstly, companies should promote the use of more environmentally friendly materials. For example, coffee giant Starbucks recently replaced plastic straws with reusable alternatives made from materials such as paper or bamboo. Secondly, regulators need to enforce strict regulations on the consumer goods industry. For example, they can impose heavy fines on these manufacturing companies for littering or polluting the local environment, which can protect the local environment from being polluted by irresponsible behavior. of these companies.\n\nIn conclusion, although this trend has a negative impact on the environment, there are still some possible solutions to solve this problem.\n\nProvide your assessment in the specified JSON format."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"per_criterion\": [{\"name\": \"Task Response\", \"band\": 6.0, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"The growth in the manufacture of consumer goods leads to in destruction to the natural environment\", \"For instance, in a rural area of ​​China, a large number of trees are cut down in the forest to put into factories to produce house construction materials and tools\", \"In conclusion, although this trend has a negative impact on the environment, there are still some possible solutions to solve this problem\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"The growth in the manufacture of consumer goods leads to in destruction to the natural environment\", \"type\": \"task\", \"fix\": \"Consider improving the task response aspect here.\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Develop your main arguments more fully with specific examples.\", \"Ensure you address all parts of the question directly.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Coherence & Cohesion\", \"band\": 5.0, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"The growth in the manufacture of consumer goods leads to in destruction to the natural environment\", \"For instance, in a rural area of ​​China, a large number of trees are cut down in the forest to put into factories to produce house construction materials and tools\", \"In conclusion, although this trend has a negative impact on the environment, there are still some possible solutions to solve this problem\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"The growth in the manufacture of consumer goods leads to in destruction to the natural environment\", \"type\": \"coherence\", \"fix\": \"Consider improving the coherence & cohesion aspect here.\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Use more varied linking words to connect your ideas.\", \"Improve paragraph structure with clearer topic sentences.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Lexical Resource\", \"band\": 5.0, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"The growth in the manufacture of consumer goods leads to in destruction to the natural environment\", \"For instance, in a rural area of ​​China, a large number of trees are cut down in the forest to put into factories to produce house construction materials and tools\", \"In conclusion, although this trend has a negative impact on the environment, there are still some possible solutions to solve this problem\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"The growth in the manufacture of consumer goods leads to in destruction to the natural environment\", \"type\": \"lexical\", \"fix\": \"Consider improving the lexical resource aspect here.\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Use more sophisticated vocabulary and avoid repetition.\", \"Focus on precise word choice and natural collocations.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Grammatical Range & Accuracy\", \"band\": 6.0, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"The growth in the manufacture of consumer goods leads to in destruction to the natural environment\", \"For instance, in a rural area of ​​China, a large number of trees are cut down in the forest to put into factories to produce house construction materials and tools\", \"In conclusion, although this trend has a negative impact on the environment, there are still some possible solutions to solve this problem\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"The growth in the manufacture of consumer goods leads to in destruction to the natural environment\", \"type\": \"grammar\", \"fix\": \"Consider improving the grammatical range & accuracy aspect here.\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Use more complex sentence structures.\", \"Check for grammatical errors and improve accuracy.\"]}], \"overall\": 5.5}"}]}

However, the concept of imposing unpaid work on them to benefit the local community raises issues regarding ethics and perhaps even the law. Therefore, I wholeheartedly disagree with it.\r\n\r\nIt is integral that we consider this issue in a more ethical manner. Teenagers, as they stand, are already making a considerable impact on our society through academics alone. It would simply be outrageous to add onto their responsibilities and require them to balance both work and school, let alone unpaid work. As teenagers, they have the right to experience everything their youth has to offer— spending time with friends, finding hobbies, doing fun activities, and so on. Studying already takes up enough of their time.\r\n\r\nBut of course, there are legal factors that come into play as well. Teenagers are, by definition, people aged between 13-19 years. Thus, most teenagers would be considered minors. In turn, under the eyes of the law, that may make forcing teenagers to work equivalent to child labor in most cases. \r\n\r\nTo conclude, I absolutely disagree with requiring teenagers to do unpaid work to benefit the local community.

Why do people want to do this? Is it a positive or negative development?\n\nScore this IELTS Task 2 essay according to the rubric, ensuring alignment with the question:\n\nTo some people in certain parts of the world, having some understanding of their own family tree is becoming an ongoing trend. In my opinion, there are certified reasons behind this, and even with some concern about this idea being adverse, it is undoubtedly a positive development. \r\n\r\nThe key rationale behind this might be that some individuals are eager to see their relatives again after being separated for a long time. For example, some families had to scatter to places for years to avoid wars or internal conflicts in their countries, in order to ensure their survival. By knowing about the background of the families, people might track back to their roots and find their distant cousins who might still remain in this area. Another cause leading to this trend stems from the fact that some people are determined to rediscover family secrets that have faded after centuries. For instance, some families might have a royal background; nevertheless, they lost their statuses for unknown reasons. Hence, if the history of the family is thoroughly analysed, the descendants might regain the respect and dignity that their ancestors once had. \r\n\r\nEven with the controversy surrounding this trend, I concur that this trend can be advantageous. Regarding the individual aspect, having a profound knowledge of his family tree would be of great assistance to the enjoyment of studying history, which is vital for countries that put an emphasis on this subject. In addition, one boasting sufficient details about his family can utilise some of the stories from the past to write journals or historical documentaries, all of which might become valuable assets to pass down to the next generation. Some might worry that this act would unveil some notorious stories of a plethora of respectable names in the past, which might be damaging to their stature; nonetheless, I reckon this would help the mass to have a more comprehensive view of their own predecessors. \r\n\r\nTo conclude, in view of the desire to reunite with long-lost family members and to reveal some secrets of their family names, some people are researching the history of their families meticulously, which I think is beneficial.

We are living in a globalization era with technological advancements  becoming one of the basic demands. From my perspective, I think that having large public spaces such as playgrounds is the ultimate idea for creating a socialised zone.

The squares will prevent the communities from breaking down by social media platforms that act as a public space for people who use the internet. \r\n\r\nFrom what I have experienced, I surely suggest every state  settle these public areas such as gardens which are great long-term benefits for the communities.

Some people think it has a negative effect on children, while others disagree. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.\n\nScore this IELTS Task 2 essay according to the rubric, ensuring alignment with the question:\n\nThese days, there is a growing trend of families moving to various foreign countries in search of work. Some people argue this could have negative impacts on children. However, I think moving abroad to work results in their children’s exposing to foreign education systems and cultures.\n\nFrom one side, a family moving abroad to work can cause some problems. First, taking children to other countries would have a negative impact on child psychology. To illustrate this, kids could take a long time to integrate into new environment and culture, since they have to leave their close friends and family members contributing to their loneliness and homesick. Second, learning new language could be the biggest barrier to them. When they go to school in a foreign country, they could not be able to keep up with academic and linguistic ability of their new classmates. When their ability to acquire knowledge is decreased due to the language barrier at the beginning, this would lead them to feel stressed and disappointed themselves.\n\nOn the other hand, working overseas and taking all their children to live with could bring various benefits to them. For one thing, working abroad would offer them better working opportunity to earn money and raise their child better. As a result, their families’ living standards and monthly salary would be improved, especially for those living in undeveloped countries. Therefore, their children will have a better living condition to develop. In addition, going to another country assist their kids to have a better education system. For example, some Vietnamese people move to many developed countries, because the school curriculum will help their children to enhance their knowledge and skills completely. This leads their kids to having a better future career when they grow up.\n\nIn conclusion, an increasing number of people migrating overseas to work are increasing these days, and they mostly bring their families to these countries.

To what extent do you agree or disagree?\n\nScore this IELTS Task 2 essay according to the rubric, ensuring alignment with the question:\n\nAfter graduating, many people look for a job. Sometimes they want to work in their passion while others do not take passion as an important thing but the experience and how it can support their lives. Admittedly, the work may be difficult to follow in the beginning but over  time workers can feel the enjoyment because they get the pattern for their work. Therefore, I completely disagree with that statement.\r\n\r\nTo begin with, these days getting a passion work is not easy since there are plenty of people looking for the job as well. For example, fresh undergraduate students try to get work as same as their excitement but it takes some time. While waiting for their feedback application, undoubtedly, they need funds as well to buy their pieces of stuff. Moreover, if they ignored their tasks when they were already in the work environment, it would jeopardise them since they would not get any promotion or trust from the company.\r\n\r\nAnother point to consider is working in different areas sometimes can expand more experiences as well as networking. At first, staff may be hard to start when they have no intention of carrying out the job. For instance, someone who has an undergraduate in design and has passion in that area surprisingly accepts a job in a different area as public relations. In her new field, she has to take more time to learn but as time goes by she finally enjoys it and scales up the experience in that field. In addition, when people accept a job, they are used to knowing  their responsibilities, so it is unacceptable if they do not want to perform just because they do not feel joy in it.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, working with the same passion might be the dream for everyone whereas these days people have to compete with each other to get the job, as a blue-collar or white-collar. I disagree with the statement because employees have to fulfil their tasks which contribute to the company’s goal despite of like or dislike since they already sign the contract with the company.

Although educating the civilizations through the museum is crucial, I believe that these could also be used as a source of entertainment.\n\nAt the outset, one main reason that museums are needed to be used for educational purpose is that these can work as live presentations. As various subjects related to History and Art have been read by people in their schools and institutions, but not every person is capable to remember longer theoretical texts. Thus, by visiting such places the practical aspects of that particular subject have been accomplished and in-depth knowledge can be required. To exemplify, a report produced by the Education Department states that school children who have visited museums can have 60% more grip on the subject of history.\n\nOn the other hand, by making the museums more enjoyable, more benefit could be achieved. Firstly, due to the influence of cinema and theatre, if we can make museums more entertaining, more visitors and tourists can get attracted towards these significant places. So from an economic viewpoint, by charging reasonable fees, this money could be used for the maintenance of ancient artefacts. Secondly, by increasing the number of tourists, museums can bring laurels to the country. The Madame Tussaud, a wax museum, is a good example of this which has brought a sense of pride for London on the world level. Thirdly, the information could be grasped more easily if it is provided enjoyably. Because learners are more open to the facts and hence, from my viewpoint, entertainment is also beneficial in the field of education, if it is used in museums.\n\nIn conclusion, it is a matter of debate that what should be the purpose of museums.

As a result, protecting the environment and keeping plants and animals safe has become one of the most controversial issues among scientists and environmental activists. In this regard, some people claim that the current situation can not be improved, while others take the opposite side and believe that some practical decisions should be made. \r\n\r\nOn the one hand, some people are of the opinion that the current trend that has been occurring in the world in recent decades is uncontrolled and can not be stopped easily. They believe population explosion and as a result, exploitation of nature and its resources such as water and plants in order to produce foodstuff and necessary products is unavoidable. This is because, in their statements, humans should take priority over all the other creatures. Therefore, it could be noted that, instead of investing huge amounts of either financial or human resources to save some rare species, which can be considered a waste of money because of their insufficiency, we ought to allocate this budget and workforce to enhance the health care and education system in poor countries. For instance, the latest statistics illustrate that the average budget of typical conservation programmes is equal to constructing 50000 schools in Africa where the majority of kids suffer from a lack of education.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, many experts state that the current circumstances send a clear message that the globe is going to be unhabitable in the near future for all beings including mankind. This means that planning and implementing conservation programmes and strict rules in order to save special plants and animals not only help them to escape from the circle of extinction but also could shape our children's future in a far more efficient way. As a result, providing that the governments assist to keep the environment in balance by imposing harsh rules to deter factories and individuals from destroying nature, the position will be improved significantly.

Discuss both sides and give your opinion.\n\nScore this IELTS Task 2 essay according to the rubric, ensuring alignment with the question:\n\nA highly controversial issue today relates to whether any knowledge gained is a waste. A particular population group believes that art is an important course for offspring at school while others think otherwise. In the essay, I will be looking at both points of view and explain why I believe that craft is essential knowledge.\r\n\r\nTo begin with, there are a number of arguments in support of my stance, the most preponderant is that evidently, what kids learn while growing up sharpens their behaviour and also has an effect on their career choices. For example, in developed countries like the US, someone can find special profession classes to enrol their children like ballet, gymnastics, and many more. As a result, these folks with early training turn out to be future world champions in these areas.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, It can as well be seen as a waste of time for parents who already have plans for their offspring. Clearly, this set of people aspires for their children to end up with professional careers like medical doctors, lawyers, engineers and all what not. For instance, parents who have a course plan mapped out for their folks would see art lessons as a distraction towards the goal and therefore be wary of them getting injured in the process of practising such lessons. However, it is advised that offspring should not be forced to follow a certain career path.\r\n\r\nIn summary, to recapitulate the aforementioned argument, While a certain group of persons believe the introduction of craft in school for kids is time-wasting, others, nevertheless, feel it is essential.

To what extent do you agree or disagree?\n\nScore this IELTS Task 2 essay according to the rubric, ensuring alignment with the question:\n\nThere are several threats to living in our environment. This has led to some individuals to say that increasing the price of fuel for cars and other vehicles like trucks or buses, is the most effective method to solve many of the environmental problems. I completely agree with this view. The reasons for my opinion will be discussed below.\n\nTo start with, some people do not believe that increasing the charge on the fuel used by motor vehicles is an appropriate way to combat the challenges we face in our surrounding. Their major reason is that this approach will make life unbearable for the poor who perceive it as the cheapest mode of transportation. Similarly, only the rich could afford to buy or use the expensive alternatives for travel. For example, most income earners in developing nations such as Nigeria, commute by car or by bus. So any plan to increase the fuel price will restrcit their travel experience. However, I disagree with this view as it does not consider the damaging effect it has on the environment in the long run.\n\nAdmittedly, there are basic reasons why I believe that a hike in the price of fuel for automobiles will go a long way to solve many of the problems we encounter in our environment. Firstly, it will reduce the number of such vehicles on our road. Consequently, there will be less pollution in the atmosphere as the amount of carbon monoxide, which is the major threat to life, released into the air is greatly minimised. Additionally, commuters will no longer experience traffic congestion. Secondly, it will promote the invention of vehicles that use other energy sources such as electricity or solar energy which are environmentally friendly. For instance, most people in developed countries like China, use electric cars and encourage the use of bicycles for short distance travel. This has helped to reduce climate change in their environment.\n\nIn conclusion, I agree that a rise in the cost of fuel for cars or buses will discourage its use and encourage people to seek better alternatives.

To what extent do you agree or disagree?\n\nScore this IELTS Task 2 essay according to the rubric, ensuring alignment with the question:\n\nSome individuals argue that nations should prioritize financial investments in skills and vocational training for practical work over higher education. While I acknowledge the validity of this viewpoint to some extent, I firmly believe that higher education encompasses more essential considerations than professional training.\r\n\r\nOn one hand, advocating for the option of direct training carries certain advantages. A notable benefit is a potential reduction in study time due to the exclusion of certain academic subjects in shorter training programs. Unlike traditional university education, which typically spans at least four years, these training courses can be completed within one to two years. Consequently, many students are able to embark on their professional careers at an earlier stage compared to their peers. Moreover, this approach allows students to gain firsthand experience in their intended fields, aiding in the identification of their strengths and weaknesses, ultimately enabling them to chart a suitable career path.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, numerous compelling reasons support my conviction that high school graduates should choose to pursue higher education. Firstly, students need a comprehensive understanding of the nature of their future work and its broader implications for areas such as the environment or human life. For instance, students majoring in Information Technology require in-depth knowledge to decipher complex algorithms, including concepts rooted in mathematics and statistical probabilities. Such proficiency would be challenging to acquire within the limited study schedules of immediate training courses. Secondly, possessing a degree plays a crucial role in ensuring the future advancement of young individuals. The majority of desirable job positions demand at least a bachelor's degree, even for entry-level internships. Consequently, the absence of such a degree restricts individuals to manual labour or service industry jobs.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, while it is undeniable that focusing national efforts on job-oriented training can yield certain advantages, I contend that the drawbacks it presents are significantly more notable.

In my opinion, I firmly disagree with this argument as it has the potential to disrupt world economy and global peace severely.\nTo begin with, transportation, industrial production, and even energy generation sectors run their operations on oil. If the oil prices are increased, it raises the prices of the products and services of these sectors as well. As a result, this affects the general public’s ability to afford basic products and services which is known as inflation. This does not only affects the households but also slows down the overall growth of the economy. For instance, in developing countries, it is often observed that whenever the petrol price jumps up, the economic growth jumps down.     \nMoreover, increasing the fuel cost not just disturbs the economy, it can promote instability as well. When people are unable to afford the basic necessities, they get frustrated. This often leads to protest and sometimes these protests are converted into violent demonstrations, which not only results in the loss of public property, but also human lives. For example, in recent days, a protest against oil prices increase in Iran spread across the country which compelled the authorities to contain it by force and restricting mobile and internet services in the affected areas. \nIn conclusion, I think that without any alternative options for fuel, increasing the fuel prices is not the solution to the global environmental issues, but a trigger to affect the world economy and global peace and stability.\n\nProvide your assessment in the specified JSON format."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"per_criterion\": [{\"name\": \"Coherence & Cohesion\", \"band\": 6.0, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"Some consider raising fuel prices as the most effective method to resolve global environmental issues\", \"For instance, in developing countries, it is often observed that whenever the petrol price jumps up, the economic growth jumps down\", \"In conclusion, I think that without any alternative options for fuel, increasing the fuel prices is not the solution to the global environmental issues, but a trigger to affect the world economy and global peace and stability\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"Some consider raising fuel prices as the most effective method to resolve global environmental issue\", \"type\": \"coherence\", \"fix\": \"Consider improving the coherence & cohesion aspect here.\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Use more varied linking words to connect your ideas.\", \"Improve paragraph structure with clearer topic sentences.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Task Response\", \"band\": 7.5, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"Some consider raising fuel prices as the most effective method to resolve global environmental issues\", \"For instance, in developing countries, it is often observed that whenever the petrol price jumps up, the economic growth jumps down\", \"In conclusion, I think that without any alternative options for fuel, increasing the fuel prices is not the solution to the global environmental issues, but a trigger to affect the world economy and global peace and stability\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"Some consider raising fuel prices as the most effective method to resolve global environmental issue\", \"type\": \"task\", \"fix\": \"Consider improving the task response aspect here.\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Develop your main arguments more fully with specific examples.\", \"Ensure you address all parts of the question directly.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Lexical Resource\", \"band\": 6.5, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"Some consider raising fuel prices as the most effective method to resolve global environmental issues\", \"For instance, in developing countries, it is often observed that whenever the petrol price jumps up, the economic growth jumps down\", \"In conclusion, I think that without any alternative options for fuel, increasing the fuel prices is not the solution to the global environmental issues, but a trigger to affect the world economy and global peace and stability\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"Some consider raising fuel prices as the most effective method to resolve global environmental issue\", \"type\": \"lexical\", \"fix\": \"Consider improving the lexical resource aspect here.\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Use more sophisticated vocabulary and avoid repetition.\", \"Focus on precise word choice and natural collocations.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Grammatical Range & Accuracy\", \"band\": 6.5, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"Some consider raising fuel prices as the most effective method to resolve global environmental issues\", \"For instance, in developing countries, it is often observed that whenever the petrol price jumps up, the economic growth jumps down\", \"In conclusion, I think that without any alternative options for fuel, increasing the fuel prices is not the solution to the global environmental issues, but a trigger to affect the world economy and global peace and stability\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"Some consider raising fuel prices as the most effective method to resolve global environmental issue\", \"type\": \"grammar\", \"fix\": \"Consider improving the grammatical range & accuracy aspect here.\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Use more complex sentence structures.\", \"Check for grammatical errors and improve accuracy.\"]}], \"overall\": 7.0}"}]}

In my personal view, museums can and should play a role in both educating and entertaining. \nOn the one hand, it can be argued that the main role of a museum is to educate. Museums contain and preserve a huge number of historical records and ancient objects, which is used to broaden people's knowledge of previous events, human history or world in the future. This means that museums have to find many different ways to explain and give knowledge to people clearly and easily. Some museums employ professional guides to talk to their visitors while the others offer headsets so that visitors can listen to the details about the records or exhibitions. In addition, a few schools organise extracurricular activities such as tours of the museums and after these tours, students have to write a report of their experience. By this way, museums can play an important role in teaching people about the history, culture, science, technology and many other aspects of life. \nOn the other hand, many people think that museums are tourist attractions and entertaining places. Some museums relate to art, nature or technology are exhibiting a great quantity of interesting things that people want to see. In order to attract more visitors and diminish their boredom, many museums have  taken advantage of advanced technology to make their exhibitions become vivid.

To what extent do you agree or disagree?\n\nScore this IELTS Task 2 essay according to the rubric, ensuring alignment with the question:\n\nIt is prevalent for people to opine that increasing fuel prices for vehicles is the best way to address environmental issues. While, this school of thought is valid to some extent based on reducing the number of vehicles and alleviating the exploitation of fossil fuel, I am of the opinion that there are several ways to solve environmental problems besides that measure related to rules and public awareness. \r\n\r\nThere are a variety of compelling reasons why higher fuel costs can deal with environmental problems. Firstly, this method may decrease fuel vehicle usage and ownership. If the price of fuel, which is needed for cars to activate, people tend to swift to transportation that requires less fuel such as buses or bicycles. In 2022, many surveys have indicated that since the cost of fuel peaked after 20 years due to the war, the rate of people taking public transportation and riding bicycles increased. Secondly, higher fuel charges might lessen the exploitation. When rising the fuel price, many companies lost their interest in  investing in the process of utilizing fossil fuel. Therefore, fewer and fewer minerals may be made use of and also devoted to preserving the variety of the world's minerals. \r\n\r\nDespite the aforementioned benefits, I believe that some other measures can be adopted to address ecological issues. One primary approach is  raising public awareness. Government can organise presentations and events to tell the community what problems can result from deteriorating environment. Protecting the environment is not only a duty of administrations but also the public as a whole. Moreover, authorities can impose regulations to improve waste treatment and reduce pollution. They can expand the landfills and waste disposal of factories and civilizations, hence several types of pollution such as air and water are eased. \r\n\r\nIn conclusion, while some claim that a higher fuel fee is the ideal method to solve ecological problems based on lessening  fossil fuel usage and exploitation, it seems to me that other measures can be utilized such as  increasing societal consciousness and implementing rules to limit pollution.\n\nProvide your assessment in the specified JSON format."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"per_criterion\": [{\"name\": \"Task Response\", \"band\": 5.0, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"It is prevalent for people to opine that increasing fuel prices for vehicles is the best way to address environmental issues\", \"Therefore, fewer and fewer minerals may be made use of and also devoted to preserving the variety of the world's minerals\", \"In conclusion, while some claim that a higher fuel fee is the ideal method to solve ecological problems based on lessening  fossil fuel usage and exploitation, it seems to me that other measures can be utilized such as  increasing societal consciousness and implementing rules to limit pollution\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"It is prevalent for people to opine that increasing fuel prices for vehicles is the best way to addr\", \"type\": \"task\", \"fix\": \"Consider improving the task response aspect here.\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Develop your main arguments more fully with specific examples.\", \"Ensure you address all parts of the question directly.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Coherence & Cohesion\", \"band\": 4.0, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"It is prevalent for people to opine that increasing fuel prices for vehicles is the best way to address environmental issues\", \"Therefore, fewer and fewer minerals may be made use of and also devoted to preserving the variety of the world's minerals\", \"In conclusion, while some claim that a higher fuel fee is the ideal method to solve ecological problems based on lessening  fossil fuel usage and exploitation, it seems to me that other measures can be utilized such as  increasing societal consciousness and implementing rules to limit pollution\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"It is prevalent for people to opine that increasing fuel prices for vehicles is the best way to addr\", \"type\": \"coherence\", \"fix\": \"Consider improving the coherence & cohesion aspect here.\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Use more varied linking words to connect your ideas.\", \"Improve paragraph structure with clearer topic sentences.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Lexical Resource\", \"band\": 4.0, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"It is prevalent for people to opine that increasing fuel prices for vehicles is the best way to address environmental issues\", \"Therefore, fewer and fewer minerals may be made use of and also devoted to preserving the variety of the world's minerals\", \"In conclusion, while some claim that a higher fuel fee is the ideal method to solve ecological problems based on lessening  fossil fuel usage and exploitation, it seems to me that other measures can be utilized such as  increasing societal consciousness and implementing rules to limit pollution\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"It is prevalent for people to opine that increasing fuel prices for vehicles is the best way to addr\", \"type\": \"lexical\", \"fix\": \"Consider improving the lexical resource aspect here.\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Use more sophisticated vocabulary and avoid repetition.\", \"Focus on precise word choice and natural collocations.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Grammatical Range & Accuracy\", \"band\": 5.0, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"It is prevalent for people to opine that increasing fuel prices for vehicles is the best way to address environmental issues\", \"Therefore, fewer and fewer minerals may be made use of and also devoted to preserving the variety of the world's minerals\", \"In conclusion, while some claim that a higher fuel fee is the ideal method to solve ecological problems based on lessening  fossil fuel usage and exploitation, it seems to me that other measures can be utilized such as  increasing societal consciousness and implementing rules to limit pollution\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"It is prevalent for people to opine that increasing fuel prices for vehicles is the best way to addr\", \"type\": \"grammar\", \"fix\": \"Consider improving the grammatical range & accuracy aspect here.\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Use more complex sentence structures.\", \"Check for grammatical errors and improve accuracy.\"]}], \"overall\": 4.5}"}]}

To what extent do you agree or disagree?\n\nScore this IELTS Task 2 essay according to the rubric, ensuring alignment with the question:\n\nIt is believed that the learning model in which students and teachers must go to school to access knowledge will be replaced by the year 2050. Although there are several reasons for this forecast, I believe that this kind of teaching model plays an indispensable role in students’ acquisition of knowledge.\r\n\r\nOn the one hand, advocates of this idea may have some rationales to argue that the year 2050 will not record the presence of the existing learning model. Firstly, the introduction of online learning platforms has enabled learners to access information regardless of physical barriers. For example, students in different countries can have access to a variety of knowledge from physics to arts with the clicks of the mouse, which facilitates learners from long distances. Moreover, recently, artificial intelligence (AI) has been introduced in educational sectors, which assesses students’ learning process and then dispenses personalized instructions as well as feedback with astonishing accuracy rates. All of which used to be the functionality of teachers and therefore, the physical presence of educators has been questioned. \r\n\r\nHowever, although technology innovation offers learners a wide variety of knowledge, students may not comprehensively understand it. For example, whether an unemotional and rigid teaching machine can convey knowledge as efficiently as teachers whose teaching approach is varied to suit different types of students. They can be amiable and helpful to students who struggle with acquiring knowledge or strict to learners who slack off their studies. Furthermore, the learning process is not only the acquisition of theoretical knowledge but also practical skills. A classroom that includes the physical presence of students and teachers plays a role as a small-scale society and therefore students in the class have the opportunity to be exposed to different counterparts with different characteristics, therefore, improving their interpersonal skills and team-working skills. \r\n\r\nIn conclusion, although the role of teachers and existing learning models are under threat due to technological innovation, I believe they can not be replaced because they bring about many benefits for students’s academic performance and practical skills.\n\nProvide your assessment in the specified JSON format."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"per_criterion\": [{\"name\": \"Task Response\", \"band\": 7.0, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"It is believed that the learning model in which students and teachers must go to school to access knowledge will be replaced by the year 2050\", \"All of which used to be the functionality of teachers and therefore, the physical presence of educators has been questioned\", \"In conclusion, although the role of teachers and existing learning models are under threat due to technological innovation, I believe they can not be replaced because they bring about many benefits for students’s academic performance and practical skills\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"It is believed that the learning model in which students and teachers must go to school to access kn\", \"type\": \"task\", \"fix\": \"Consider improving the task response aspect here.\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Develop your main arguments more fully with specific examples.\", \"Ensure you address all parts of the question directly.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Coherence & Cohesion\", \"band\": 6.0, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"It is believed that the learning model in which students and teachers must go to school to access knowledge will be replaced by the year 2050\", \"All of which used to be the functionality of teachers and therefore, the physical presence of educators has been questioned\", \"In conclusion, although the role of teachers and existing learning models are under threat due to technological innovation, I believe they can not be replaced because they bring about many benefits for students’s academic performance and practical skills\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"It is believed that the learning model in which students and teachers must go to school to access kn\", \"type\": \"coherence\", \"fix\": \"Consider improving the coherence & cohesion aspect here.\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Use more varied linking words to connect your ideas.\", \"Improve paragraph structure with clearer topic sentences.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Lexical Resource\", \"band\": 6.0, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"It is believed that the learning model in which students and teachers must go to school to access knowledge will be replaced by the year 2050\", \"All of which used to be the functionality of teachers and therefore, the physical presence of educators has been questioned\", \"In conclusion, although the role of teachers and existing learning models are under threat due to technological innovation, I believe they can not be replaced because they bring about many benefits for students’s academic performance and practical skills\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"It is believed that the learning model in which students and teachers must go to school to access kn\", \"type\": \"lexical\", \"fix\": \"Consider improving the lexical resource aspect here.\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Use more sophisticated vocabulary and avoid repetition.\", \"Focus on precise word choice and natural collocations.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Grammatical Range & Accuracy\", \"band\": 7.0, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"It is believed that the learning model in which students and teachers must go to school to access knowledge will be replaced by the year 2050\", \"All of which used to be the functionality of teachers and therefore, the physical presence of educators has been questioned\", \"In conclusion, although the role of teachers and existing learning models are under threat due to technological innovation, I believe they can not be replaced because they bring about many benefits for students’s academic performance and practical skills\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"It is believed that the learning model in which students and teachers must go to school to access kn\", \"type\": \"grammar\", \"fix\": \"Consider improving the grammatical range & accuracy aspect here.\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Use more complex sentence structures.\", \"Check for grammatical errors and improve accuracy.\"]}], \"overall\": 6.5}"}]}

Both views will be discussed in this essay, coming to a conclusion at the end. \n\nSome people argue that the only avenue by which young people can bring about a chance is by applying for a job immediately after school in order to succeed in their careers. First and foremost, only by doing a job that can  young members get acquainted with how to meet challenges in their real life. It is encountering difficulties in working place that can make a more significant contribution to make a success e in a career. By way of illustration, making money at a young age can lay the groundwork for an independent life. Meanwhile, the young live up to  lower expectations normally compared to those having tertiary education. Not only do they work with a minimum wage but also, they work under pressure to prove themselves by assuming heavy responsibility. On top of that, they enjoy more practical and valuable experience than those inexperienced in an academic environment. \n\nHowever, securing a job directly after school have beneficial for young individuals, continuing, and completing courses at college or university outweighs the disadvantages. To begin with, without higher education, individuals will not be eligible to apply for idle job vacancies and go into a market straightforwardly. With university or college being the best place, they are able to build a close rapport between outstanding students and their professors to carve a niche in their future career.

It is one of the most demanded skills for job in every sector.  If they spend most of their time in learning art they will not be able to face cut-throat competitions of this scenario. Moreover, the knowledge of essential subjects like math, science is highly required in every field. Secondly, Art despite being highly appreciated, still do not ensure any career growth because most of the fields like engineering, marketing, IT professionals and managers are a found graduated and post graduated in these important subjects.\n\nOn the other flip side of the coin, art is a creative skill that has wonderful imagination power. It provides the wings to the fantasy and expresses the feelings without exchange of words. To illustrate, once I have come across with the painting in which the difference between the rich and poor’s plight was depicted through painting only. Moreover, music is also a piece of art and works as a healing therapy into hectic world.  Secondly, artists bring laurels for the country across the world and ensure that the cultural heritage of the country may not extinct.  For this they are highly paid and appreciated.

To what extent do you agree or disagree?\n\nScore this IELTS Task 2 essay according to the rubric, ensuring alignment with the question:\n\nIn this modern world, it is argued by some politicians and authorities that climate change has been occurring for many years that is the reason why the governments should provide a solution to live in a way rather than some precautions. I partially agree with that statement and I believe that while people adapt to living with climate change and global warming, countries have to show their effort as much as possible to decrease the increasing trend of temperature.\nFirst of all, since the beginning of the Industrial Revolution, hazardous gases and wastewaters have been released by factories to nature. Moreover, it firstly has been caused global warming, then climate change. This harmful situation affected not only human beings but also all the species around the world. To save wildlife and diversity of species, governments should publish a law to ensure the nature will be protected. For instance, if biodiversity changes, all the food production and people’s nutritional behaviour will change too. Furthermore, oceans and inner sea's temperature have increased by years. For instance, while a person who lives in Greenland was not able to swim in the 1970s due to icebergs, now Greenland has become a tourist destination with its beaches. How do not people protest climate changes after witnessing that undesirable situation?\nOn the other hand, whereas governments and individuals have been showing their effort to save the environment, it is clearly seen that the average temperature of the world has been increasing constantly. Additionally, almost all countries spend a huge amount of money every year in order to protect nature. In contrast, if they invest in the health care system, infrastructures of big cities and most importantly, innovation of agriculture, it would be more beneficial not only for governments financially but also for citizens.

I believe that allowing pupils to provide feedback to the tutor is unacceptable. \r\n\r\nOn the one hand, some institutions encourage their students to encourage and criticise their teachers, so that they can determine the strengths and weaknesses of those tutors. Since students are the ones who have the most access to teachers, they are the best options for the schools to draw an insight of how they can improve their education, and the school can assess the academic staff from different criteria such as punctuality, teaching quality and interaction. For instance, I am an example of this, my school always handed out an evaluation form at the end of the semester for the scholars to provide feedback regarding the study contents, and evaluate how those teachers deliver the contents.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, schools should not ask their students to fill in the evaluation forms, as they do not have the qualification to provide feedback or criticise the tutors. The academy principals and their recruitment team know best which candidates are the best fit for the institute, and the recruitment team went through several rounds of interviews to choose the best candidates to ensure that they can improve  their learning facilities. In addition, since students at this age are still growing physically and mentally, therefore, they often use their emotions to decide, rather than focusing on the details. For instance, a study conducted by the University of London shows that high school students are very emotional due to changes in their hormones. Thus, their emotions influence their decision-making.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, although giving feedback to their tutor can provide insights on how the institutions can do better, the students are not the right judgment in this case, as they do not have the quality to criticise and their emotions often lead to their decision-making outcome.\n\nProvide your assessment in the specified JSON format."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"per_criterion\": [{\"name\": \"Coherence & Cohesion\", \"band\": 6.5, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"Some people argue that to improve the teaching standards of a school, students are urged to provide feedback to their teachers, while others say that this might create indiscipline and might be regarded as disrespectful\", \"On the other hand, schools should not ask their students to fill in the evaluation forms, as they do not have the qualification to provide feedback or criticise the tutors\", \"In conclusion, although giving feedback to their tutor can provide insights on how the institutions can do better, the students are not the right judgment in this case, as they do not have the quality to criticise and their emotions often lead to their decision-making outcome\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"Some people argue that to improve the teaching standards of a school, students are urged to provide \", \"type\": \"coherence\", \"fix\": \"Consider improving the coherence & cohesion aspect here.\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Use more varied linking words to connect your ideas.\", \"Improve paragraph structure with clearer topic sentences.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Task Response\", \"band\": 8.0, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"Some people argue that to improve the teaching standards of a school, students are urged to provide feedback to their teachers, while others say that this might create indiscipline and might be regarded as disrespectful\", \"On the other hand, schools should not ask their students to fill in the evaluation forms, as they do not have the qualification to provide feedback or criticise the tutors\", \"In conclusion, although giving feedback to their tutor can provide insights on how the institutions can do better, the students are not the right judgment in this case, as they do not have the quality to criticise and their emotions often lead to their decision-making outcome\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"Some people argue that to improve the teaching standards of a school, students are urged to provide \", \"type\": \"task\", \"fix\": \"Consider improving the task response aspect here.\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Develop your main arguments more fully with specific examples.\", \"Ensure you address all parts of the question directly.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Lexical Resource\", \"band\": 7.0, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"Some people argue that to improve the teaching standards of a school, students are urged to provide feedback to their teachers, while others say that this might create indiscipline and might be regarded as disrespectful\", \"On the other hand, schools should not ask their students to fill in the evaluation forms, as they do not have the qualification to provide feedback or criticise the tutors\", \"In conclusion, although giving feedback to their tutor can provide insights on how the institutions can do better, the students are not the right judgment in this case, as they do not have the quality to criticise and their emotions often lead to their decision-making outcome\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"Some people argue that to improve the teaching standards of a school, students are urged to provide \", \"type\": \"lexical\", \"fix\": \"Consider improving the lexical resource aspect here.\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Use more sophisticated vocabulary and avoid repetition.\", \"Focus on precise word choice and natural collocations.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Grammatical Range & Accuracy\", \"band\": 7.0, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"Some people argue that to improve the teaching standards of a school, students are urged to provide feedback to their teachers, while others say that this might create indiscipline and might be regarded as disrespectful\", \"On the other hand, schools should not ask their students to fill in the evaluation forms, as they do not have the qualification to provide feedback or criticise the tutors\", \"In conclusion, although giving feedback to their tutor can provide insights on how the institutions can do better, the students are not the right judgment in this case, as they do not have the quality to criticise and their emotions often lead to their decision-making outcome\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"Some people argue that to improve the teaching standards of a school, students are urged to provide \", \"type\": \"grammar\", \"fix\": \"Consider improving the grammatical range & accuracy aspect here.\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Use more complex sentence structures.\", \"Check for grammatical errors and improve accuracy.\"]}], \"overall\": 7.5}"}]}

I personally disagree with the statement that we depend on global scale cooperations to solve the crisis, since there could be drawbacks to counting on foreign supports.\r\n\r\nFirstly, it takes more time for anther nations’s support to arrive. Since the problem is urgent, counting on help from other countries could lead to miss the best opportunity to deal with the situation immediately. Also, local support team who are located closer to the site can respond to the issue immediately by gathering up resources and planning the solutions. All in all, local people can respond to the problem more quickly in order to mitigate the situation.\r\n\r\n\tSecondly, it is hard to organize support teams and resources come from different countries when an emergency crisis occurred, since the situation could be chaotic with  the spread of misleading informations.

In this essay, I shall explore both sides of this opinion and give my judgment to what extent I agree or disagree.\r\n\r\nThe first reason why teach children team sports is a good way to let them learn cooperation is many sports need more than one person to play. In this situation, collaborating with teammates is a key point to win the competition. In the competition, people need to communicate with each other, know each other and try to use their advantages of themselves. Another reason for team sport is the best way to learn cooperation is sport activity can help children stay healthy. Not only studying but also doing daily sport activity help children maintain their body and mental health. \r\n\r\nOn the other head, some people argue that teach children team sports at school is not a good way to let them learn what is cooperation. Sometimes, too much sports activity can make children distracted in class, they can not focus on their work and it maybe reflects on their academic performance. For those children who do not enjoy sport activity. They do not want to join those competitions.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, I believe that team sport is a good way to help children learn to cooperate, but we have to consider those kids who dislike sports and be careful not to let children do sport activity too much.\n\nProvide your assessment in the specified JSON format."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"per_criterion\": [{\"name\": \"Task Response\", \"band\": 5.0, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"Many people think that cooperation is very important to children because almost everything needs people to work together\", \"Another reason for team sport is the best way to learn cooperation is sport activity can help children stay healthy\", \"In conclusion, I believe that team sport is a good way to help children learn to cooperate, but we have to consider those kids who dislike sports and be careful not to let children do sport activity too much\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"Many people think that cooperation is very important to children because almost everything needs peo\", \"type\": \"task\", \"fix\": \"Consider improving the task response aspect here.\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Develop your main arguments more fully with specific examples.\", \"Ensure you address all parts of the question directly.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Coherence & Cohesion\", \"band\": 4.0, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"Many people think that cooperation is very important to children because almost everything needs people to work together\", \"Another reason for team sport is the best way to learn cooperation is sport activity can help children stay healthy\", \"In conclusion, I believe that team sport is a good way to help children learn to cooperate, but we have to consider those kids who dislike sports and be careful not to let children do sport activity too much\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"Many people think that cooperation is very important to children because almost everything needs peo\", \"type\": \"coherence\", \"fix\": \"Consider improving the coherence & cohesion aspect here.\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Use more varied linking words to connect your ideas.\", \"Improve paragraph structure with clearer topic sentences.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Lexical Resource\", \"band\": 4.0, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"Many people think that cooperation is very important to children because almost everything needs people to work together\", \"Another reason for team sport is the best way to learn cooperation is sport activity can help children stay healthy\", \"In conclusion, I believe that team sport is a good way to help children learn to cooperate, but we have to consider those kids who dislike sports and be careful not to let children do sport activity too much\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"Many people think that cooperation is very important to children because almost everything needs peo\", \"type\": \"lexical\", \"fix\": \"Consider improving the lexical resource aspect here.\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Use more sophisticated vocabulary and avoid repetition.\", \"Focus on precise word choice and natural collocations.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Grammatical Range & Accuracy\", \"band\": 5.0, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"Many people think that cooperation is very important to children because almost everything needs people to work together\", \"Another reason for team sport is the best way to learn cooperation is sport activity can help children stay healthy\", \"In conclusion, I believe that team sport is a good way to help children learn to cooperate, but we have to consider those kids who dislike sports and be careful not to let children do sport activity too much\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"Many people think that cooperation is very important to children because almost everything needs peo\", \"type\": \"grammar\", \"fix\": \"Consider improving the grammatical range & accuracy aspect here.\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Use more complex sentence structures.\", \"Check for grammatical errors and improve accuracy.\"]}], \"overall\": 4.5}"}]}

When we talk about real state this phrase can be true. In New York fr example when people are tenants are looking for a house they should know that is better to avoid houses that are from a certain age because at that time they didn’t have the same requirements like for example fire exits, quality of the plumbing or double glassed windows. On the other hand, because not all the old houses have to be bad, victorian houses that they can be very old have an amazing quality and apart from that the design is something that still in our times designers try to copy, but in my opinion nothing better than the original one.

There is a popular debate on whether to invest more in educating the young or the elderly, but, I think I am highly inclined to support more expenditure towards the youth.

Therefore, if we are emphasizing  educating the adolescent first, for sure  society is going to have a bright future. For instance, if a country is incessantly working on creating strong academia with healthy competition among the students from the rudimental level, definitely they are going to have highly trained intellectual youths now and on top of that, they will turn into imminent well-educated adults. On the other hand, if we don't invest in a profound educational system for the young, we will always end up with below-par educated elderlies, which doesn't serve the purpose either.\n\nOn contrary to that, educating adults is also crucial, given that, they are in charge of everything in a functional civilization. They are responsible for all financial, trade and other significant activities. Helping them to become educated has significant value. For example, many third-world countries have come out of poverty by running mass learning programs for the elderly. \n\nIn a nutshell, educating youth and the elderly is  pertinent for the development of society.

Why is this the case? Which development do you think is better?\n\nScore this IELTS Task 2 essay according to the rubric, ensuring alignment with the question:\n\nIt is believed by some people that driving vehicles are the first choice when they go out. Others, on the contrary, think that riding bicycles are prioritised. This essay will introduce reasons of the trend and give my opinions.\r\nTravelling by bikes have two advantages.Firstly,it is good for our health. The bicycle is an environment-friendly transportation as it never needs fuel, which causes no pollutants in the air. As the result, the risk of several diseases may be decreased. Secondly, Riding bicycles will save time in short distance route. There are always a large number of vehicles on the roads, especially during the rush hours in the big cities such as New York and Beijing. Instead of driving cars, riding bikes significantly reduce the traffic congestion and help residents save a lot of time in commuting.\r\nIt is also reasonable as why cars are popular in some cities. It is widely known that driving is more efficient, particularly in long distance journey. Nowadays, more and more people would like to broaden views and explore new things by tourism. Comparing with the bikes, cars which do not require a lot of energy from travellers and are much faster can save a lot of time and give explorers more opportunities to views more places and scenery. \r\nIn conclusion, in my mind, both approaches have their own pros and cons. There is no good or bad choice, It all depends on personal preference. Cycling can not only curb the carbon emissions but also help people in keeping both physical and mental health.

Because each country would worship their own gods, the restrictions might be decided by their belief, which are selected thoughtfully to choose the best suitable for a country’s tradition. As a result, the residents are more likely to embrace the laws which are enacted to punish their dwellers. Therefore, the external intervention would be unnecessary.\nOn the other hand, supports from other nations would be needed to deal with issues which have an influence on a widespread scale due to the powerfulness of developed countries. They have a major economics, conducive to gaining stable and enormous financial source, so it acts as a catalyst to approach those radical matters so that people can find a way to solve them.

Moreover, the kids who read books with their parents have more interest in reading rather than others.\r\n\r\n Additionally, making a good relationship with parents is one of the significant things in childcare.

Some people assert that art class is crucial for a child’s development, whereas many others argue that it is just a wasted effort. I tend to believe that art is as important as other subjects. \r\n\r\nThe primary factor we need to take into consideration is that art is escapism. Generally, students tend to get burned out as a result of more important lessons such as math, mother tongue, and history. Also in those “valid” subjects students get put into brackets, they have only one way to do exercises, and that way is dictated to them by teachers. For those reasons, subjects like art are a form of relaxation. There, pupils can express their feelings through painting and loosen up from previous lessons. \r\n\r\nIn contrast, parents usually take art classes as a joke and pressure their kids to only focus on those “valid” lessons because society does not accept art as a good future perspective. Nowadays the only “real” specialties are related to math, biology, and physics, so when parents admit their children into school they expect good grades in math and other important lessons but the little kids can not focus on the subject their parents want them to focus on and that leads to worse grades in both subjects. Moreover, parents get mad at children and force them to prioritize not the “relaxing” lessons but the ones that they think are more prospective. \r\n\r\nHaving considered both views, I believe that art is as important and a “real” subject as other lessons.

To what extent do you agree or disagree?\n\nScore this IELTS Task 2 essay according to the rubric, ensuring alignment with the question:\n\nThere have been significant developments in relation to communication in recent years, however it is often argued that this technological progress had had a detrimental effect on many people’s relationships. Although in numerous cases damage is being done to social interactions, I also strongly maintain that there are undeniable benefits that have been brought by internet-based methods of communication.\nCorresponding online can clearly be a hindrance in many situations. The principal drawback is that social websites such as Facebook can be very addictive, therefore people spend less time communicating face to face. It is commonplace to see group of friends or family members who are gathered together in a social situation, however their main focus is frequently their smartphones. Secondly, the anonymous nature of online communications can also be very damaging. Due to the fact that posts and group messages are often sent without the recipient knowing the sender personally, users are frequently more thoughtless, or even abusive, compared to what they can be held accountable for their words.\nDespite the aforementioned harmful aspects, the latest communication devices are also advantageous in a variety of respects. Firstly, prior to the introduction of the internet, there were limited opportunities to keep in contact with others. Many examples have been seen of childhood friends who lost contact as a result of moving to a new town or attending a diffrerent university. With the introduction of social networking, this situation is now easily avoidable. In addition, social media also provides opportunities to build new relationships with likeminded people. By taking advantage of social groups and mutual friend recommendations, connections can now be built anywhere across the world. Looking back 20 years, it was uncommon for friends to be made outside of a local community.\nTo conclude, there is no doubt that communication methods have been revolutionised over the last two decades.

This trend has divided public's opinion into advocates and detractors. Having children later on is a consequence of a few factors.\nFirstly, these days an indispensable role in today's society is in education, which is time consuming and very often young students are unable to become parents due to being focused on the acquisition of new knowledge and gaining professional qualifications.\n\nSecondly, after finishing university, the young generation would rather concentrate\non their future career than on having progeny.\nFurthermore, when they finally establish a strong social and financial position, they are becoming focused on creating a homely environment and introduce their babies to the world. However, sometimes it takes longer than expected due to new generation's diseases such us problem with fertility, that is often the consequence of a stressful and unhealthy lifestyle caused by the rat race.\n\n  Personally, I think that the advantages outweigh the disadvantages, because much more mature parents are taking greater care of their offspring, due to being more patient than younger people.\nMoreover, educated parents are better role models and are able to pass their acquired knowledge to their children. There was a research, which showed that the majority of teenagers who are entering univeristy, usually come from families whose members also have a degree.\n\nAnother point which supports my point of view is, that older parents, who have already established their financial position can offer their offspring better prosperity.\nIn other words, parents have resources to contribute financially in their children's education, holidays and other additional after school activities, which can reflect in better physical and emotional development.\n\nIn conclusion, the new generation seems to have their children later on than before due to longer periods of education, better access to contraception, fertility problems and a desire to establish a financial and social position in our society.

What can be done to solve this problem?\n\nScore this IELTS Task 2 essay according to the rubric, ensuring alignment with the question:\n\nnowadays, as we know that more and more consumer goods are manufactured, more and more damage has resulted in the environment. I will talk about two kinds of reasons why the environment is damaged and give my solution way.\n\nFirst of all,  the increase in the production of consumer products harms the environment in two ways: First, because mass production of disposable goods are manufactured by industries, and people who throw away garbage don’t follow the rule to classify the garbage, this is the reason why it’s easy to see solid wastes which are found in ocrea or are found on the coastline. on the other hand, when factories manufacture products more than before, more toxic wastes and emission are released from factories into nature, those factors cause the deaths of many marine creatures. furthermore, manufacturers introduce single-use products in order to provide enough products for customers. although they can increase the products quickly, these products can remain as wastes for thousands of years.\n\nActions must be taken as soon as possible to minimize the negative impacts on the environment arising from the increasing amount of consumer goods. First, companies should promote the use of eco-friendlier materials. For example, the giant coffee chain Starbucks has recently replaced plastic straws with reusable alternatives made of materials like paper or bamboo. In addition, many governments are also encouraging the development of more sustainable manufacturing processes. For instance, many states in the U.S offer tax breaks and incentives for businesses using renewable energy, and some firms are even allowed to purchase green energy at cheaper prices than traditional fossil fuels.\n\nIn conclusion, there are two main reasons why the environment is severely impacted by the increase in the production of consumer goods.

Primarily, the consumption of unhealthy packaged food and, the strenuous work culture have been made the individuals vulnerable to various lifestyle diseases.

As such, the ill-health and  stress could not be alleviated with these infrastructures, unless citizens follow a healthy way of life.

Furthermore, rather than spending too much money on these facilities, it could be used for improved medical assistance and social awareness of health.

Therefore, some individuals believe that the best way for a government to solve the problem of health such as illness and disease is by reducing environmental pollution and housing problems. While  I agree with this method is a nice scheme, but I consider that it will be another way to solve the issue.\r\n\r\nTo begin with, it’s evident that a large group of the population have to live in slums as those places where have a housing shortage and housing prices are pretty high. Normally, unhygienic surroundings will always as accommodations for those people who couldn’t afford crazy housing prices, it would  be a huge fitness hazard. As a result, the relevant departments should be preoccupied with solving the basic  accommodation issue and also offering affordable housing for poor people. Besides, a wide range of viruses usually hides in unsanitary circumstances, it mixes kinds of dirty materials and creatures and would carry harmful bacteria. When people stay there for a long time, they are easy to get ill in most cases. Thus, it’s crucial to treat environmental pollution.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, raising the public’s awareness play a key role to mitigate the risk of disease.

To what extent do you agree or disagree?\n\nScore this IELTS Task 2 essay according to the rubric, ensuring alignment with the question:\n\nEducation plays a vital role in improving human well-being. There has been an inconclusive debate about whether the main objective of going to school is to transform students into workers, instead of offering  advantages to them individually, which I agree with this viewpoint. In this essay, the reasons supporting my idea will be presented in detail. \r\n\r\nFirst of all, most ordinary schools do not teach children about the necessary skill for living such as cooking, growing vegetables, raising animals, and constructing a house. They teach only the subjects that are important for studying in  higher education  and working in the companies, including Math, Science, and languages. Therefore, children cannot rely on themselves in order to produce their own food  and build their own house, Consequently, they need to work in the companies to put food on the table and need to collect money to buy a house. To illustrate the good education, Jone Jundai, a founder of homeschooling in Chiangmai, teaches his sons to cultivate various plants to consume, to raise chickens to collect eggs, as well as build earth houses, which pupils can have their own residence since young ages. \r\n\r\nFurthermore, the recent educational system solely focuses on the score and GPA. As a result, the students who are not fit with this particular system, and may have the talents for other issues such as dancing, singing, and drawing, are identified as stupid persons  and find it difficult to get jobs. For example, Jack Ma, a founder of Alibaba companies, the second richest person in China, was rejected from many prestigious universities as he could not pass the exams and the interviews. However, nowadays he is one of the most successful persons in the world by establishing the pioneering online shopping website in China. Thus, universities are not beneficial for some people.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, according to the information mentioned above, I strongly agree with the statement due to lack of basic skills for survival, and the curriculums focusing on scores are not suitable for all students who are different and unique.\n\nProvide your assessment in the specified JSON format."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"per_criterion\": [{\"name\": \"Task Response\", \"band\": 9.0, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"Education plays a vital role in improving human well-being\", \"To illustrate the good education, Jone Jundai, a founder of homeschooling in Chiangmai, teaches his sons to cultivate various plants to consume, to raise chickens to collect eggs, as well as build earth houses, which pupils can have their own residence since young ages\", \"In conclusion, according to the information mentioned above, I strongly agree with the statement due to lack of basic skills for survival, and the curriculums focusing on scores are not suitable for all students who are different and unique\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"Education plays a vital role in improving human well-being\", \"type\": \"task\", \"fix\": \"Consider improving the task response aspect here.\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Develop your main arguments more fully with specific examples.\", \"Ensure you address all parts of the question directly.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Coherence & Cohesion\", \"band\": 8.0, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"Education plays a vital role in improving human well-being\", \"To illustrate the good education, Jone Jundai, a founder of homeschooling in Chiangmai, teaches his sons to cultivate various plants to consume, to raise chickens to collect eggs, as well as build earth houses, which pupils can have their own residence since young ages\", \"In conclusion, according to the information mentioned above, I strongly agree with the statement due to lack of basic skills for survival, and the curriculums focusing on scores are not suitable for all students who are different and unique\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"Education plays a vital role in improving human well-being\", \"type\": \"coherence\", \"fix\": \"Consider improving the coherence & cohesion aspect here.\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Use more varied linking words to connect your ideas.\", \"Improve paragraph structure with clearer topic sentences.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Lexical Resource\", \"band\": 8.0, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"Education plays a vital role in improving human well-being\", \"To illustrate the good education, Jone Jundai, a founder of homeschooling in Chiangmai, teaches his sons to cultivate various plants to consume, to raise chickens to collect eggs, as well as build earth houses, which pupils can have their own residence since young ages\", \"In conclusion, according to the information mentioned above, I strongly agree with the statement due to lack of basic skills for survival, and the curriculums focusing on scores are not suitable for all students who are different and unique\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"Education plays a vital role in improving human well-being\", \"type\": \"lexical\", \"fix\": \"Consider improving the lexical resource aspect here.\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Use more sophisticated vocabulary and avoid repetition.\", \"Focus on precise word choice and natural collocations.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Grammatical Range & Accuracy\", \"band\": 9.0, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"Education plays a vital role in improving human well-being\", \"To illustrate the good education, Jone Jundai, a founder of homeschooling in Chiangmai, teaches his sons to cultivate various plants to consume, to raise chickens to collect eggs, as well as build earth houses, which pupils can have their own residence since young ages\", \"In conclusion, according to the information mentioned above, I strongly agree with the statement due to lack of basic skills for survival, and the curriculums focusing on scores are not suitable for all students who are different and unique\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"Education plays a vital role in improving human well-being\", \"type\": \"grammar\", \"fix\": \"Consider improving the grammatical range & accuracy aspect here.\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Use more complex sentence structures.\", \"Check for grammatical errors and improve accuracy.\"]}], \"overall\": 8.5}"}]}

However, some cliam that fashion influences people lives in an adversely, others say that this has more positive effects on our day-to-day lives. This essay discuss the both viewpoints and give my opinion in the subsequent paragraphs. \r\n\r\nOn the one hand, fashion industry plays a crucial role in country's economy through import and export cloths and materials. There are massive amount of the public can get earnings from this sector such as wavers, tailors, shopers and etc. Fashion changes in every occassion, every year by the fashion designers, they are the main reason for the innovation in this sector and people also can wear new trendy dress. For example, many boutiques have started by the fashion designer and they attract the population by their new designs with what kind of material they use. Therefore, mankind are able to obtain enormous benefits in their lives. \r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the negativities of this trend cannot be ignored because it affects folk's day-to-day life differnetly which means humankind spend more money to buy new trendy dresses even they have plenty in their wardrobes. It  stimulates more buying capacities, as a result, mankind might be dressaholic. For instance, a recent survey from the Times of India said that, Indian people have spent 40% of their earnings on buying cloths which means they are being dressaholic and addicted, besides, they should save their salary for their future because anything will happen in future like if happens any medical emergency, saving money only will be helped rather than dress and fashion. \r\n\r\nTo conclude, Fashion field is an inevitable in people lives. Although it gives a plenty of advantages to the population such as livlihood and wear new trendy dress like celebrities, the public spends huge amount to buy many dresses and they become addict.

They offer valuable glimpses into the past and act as tangible connections to our ancestry and heritage. According to a belief, it is crucial to repatriate these valuable treasures and preserve them in their original homeland. In this essay, I will elaborate on my strong agreement with this notion and shed light on my support for this subject.\r\n\r\nPrimarily, artefacts carry significant historical and cultural value for the people of a nation. For instance, the Koh-I-Noor diamond, once part of India's rich heritage, is now housed in the United Kingdom's Crown Jewels collection. Returning the Koh-I-Noor to India would be a meaningful gesture, as it holds deep cultural and historical importance for the Indian people. Consequently, it would allow them to reconnect with their past and preserve a piece of their heritage for future generations.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, repatriating historical objects can play a crucial role in strengthening the nation's identity and pride. For example, The Sultan Ganj Buddha, an ancient bronze statue discovered in Bihar, is currently displayed in the Birmingham Museum and Art Gallery in the United Kingdom. Returning the Sultan Ganj Buddha to India would be an opportunity to celebrate and appreciate Indian history and spirituality. Hence, having artefacts back in their original context could help  people develop a deeper understanding of their culture and traditions.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, having engaged in the subject matter, while displaying the artefacts in foreign museums may offer educational benefits to people worldwide, we should consider the special significance of these objects to the people of their nation.

Due to the advancement of the medical field, life expectancy has been raised gradually in many countries in the world including developing countries. But unfortunately, caring for the elderly population is becoming a huge problem in every corner of the globe. \n\nwhen people are getting old, they tend to develop non-communicable diseases such as diabetes, hypertension and heart disease. Moreover, ageing will lead to memory impairment and they become dependent on others not only for their physical needs but also for psychological support as well as finance. Actually, the young generation of each family should care about the senior citizens of their family. However, in this modern world, most seniors are neglected by their offspring due to several reasons. \n\nMany decades ago, there was a thick bond among blood relations which connected each member in many aspects. people lived in extended families rather than nuclear households. This strong bond protected the geriatric population very well. \n\nIn contrast, nowadays, households are scattered and each member acts individually. Parents and grandparents are not spending adequate time with their children and grandchildren due to the busy schedules of their jobs.

To what extent do you agree or disagree?\n\nScore this IELTS Task 2 essay according to the rubric, ensuring alignment with the question:\n\nIt is suggested that punishments for immature offenders who violate standard norms should be equivalent to those imposed on adult criminals. From my perspective, I do not disagree with this idea.\r\n\r\nThe primary reason why authorities should impose equal punishments for all criminals, regardless of their age, is the severity of the crimes committed. Given that the younger generation is growing up in a technology-driven era, it is inevitable that they will be exposed to violent video games and movies, which could have a detrimental effect on their mental health and decision-making ability, ultimately leading them to commit heinous crimes. For instance, in Vietnam a few years ago, a teenager named Le Van Luyen murdered three members of an unfamiliar family, with the intention of stealing their property to indulge his gaming addiction. Despite being under 18 years old at the time, he was not completely absolved of responsibility for his heinous act.\r\n\r\nMoreover, based on scientific research, it has been concluded that the decision-making abilities of immature individuals are not yet fully developed. Therefore, it is argued that juvenile offenders should not be held fully accountable for their illegal deeds. This assertion raises the possibility that the occurrence of heinous crimes committed by increasingly younger individuals may be attributed to the exploitation of this vulnerability, allowing them to engage in brutal activities without fearing any significant consequences. For example, consider school violence, where students who engage in abusive behaviour often go unpunished by both the school and legal system.\r\n\r\nTo summarize, it is important to ensure that penalties for breaking the law are equitable for both young and adult offenders, as younger individuals are aware of the serious consequences of their actions.

Another important aspect is that we all make some mistakes in the workplace that we call  human errors. If we use robots there is no chance of a such types of errors. Hence, precision is high. We have seen so many advantages of having robots in the present-day world and this technology is growly rapidly. Therefore it definitely is a bone to  human future development. \r\n\r\nEven though, using robotics has many advantages but it has a few disadvantages too. one negative impact is that we are losing jobs due to the replacement of robots in various sectors. The most affected community is the labour force. For Instance, these days many industries use robots instead of humans. Another important adverse factor is the advancement in artificial intelligence in some fields like automatic cars which is extremely life-threatening.

Many folks believe that only the government  is able to solve this problem.

I am convinced that all the councils in the world, regardless of the region where the cities are based. I remember a friend of mine once said that in his home country, the executive prepared and constructed buildings to accommodate the citizens. I was blown away when I heard this and imagined if the government in my homeland do the same thing. However, I realize that there are other, arguably more emerging, issues that are faced by the government, that need to be solved first. So waiting for the government to singlehandedly solve the housing issue is not a wise move we can do as a resident, especially if we are not from the richest country on this planet.\n\nOn top of the government, I strongly believe that other players also play the same key role in this issue, the private sector for instance. They can contribute to tackling the issue in their own ways. Whereas banks can help its customer  get a friendly loan to buy a house, property companies could provide an easy scheme to pay for the houses. Those are only two of many examples of how private sectors are able to help.

While it not only helps them to expand their horizons,  it can lead to them discovering their strengths by expressing their inner feelings, For illustration, a friend of mine who was suffering from chronic depression, was suggested to try paintings, This helped in coming to peace with himself. Furthermore, arts as a profession can yield a considerable amount of wealth, for example, Da Vinci's paintings were sold for millions of dollars worldwide, therefore it as a career can provide not only money but fame too\n\nIn conclusion, although art is considered a niche by many, I believe that art has several benefits to the students, it can develop their creative skills right from the childhood and can help them make a career out of it.

Although such a goal can be achieved through team sports in educational institutions, I believe that there are better solutions for children to acquire that quality.\r\n\r\nAdmittedly, team sports are competitive by nature; therefore, players can enhance their communication skills, which is one of the qualities that many people need in their adult lives. Football players, for example, usually raise their teammates’ spirit when losing by using motivational language so that they can actively continue to participate in the match. In addition, a sense of responsibility can also be nurtured in team-involved sports, which means that players have to be responsible for their own roles within a team. A good example is Nguyen Quang Hai, who is one of the Vietnamese football players, he apologized to his fans and teammates for having not listened to others and had a poor performance as a result last year. \r\n\r\nHowever, the student’s involvement in team-playing sports is not the best way for them to improve their cooperation skills, as the time to take part in such activities is usually limited, and there are better long-term options at school, especially examinations and projects. Regarding the former, learners can be taught how to listen to their peers. For instance, the teacher can conduct a debate, which requires students to pay attention to their classmates’ opinions before raising their arguments. With regard to the latter, children are encouraged to develop their time management skills when participating in this form of group work, as they need to cooperate with their group mates to complete their projects before the deadline.  \r\n\r\n\tIn conclusion, despite the fact that children can learn communication skills and have a sense of responsibility via team sports, I believe that these benefits are unsustainable due to time constraints in sports participation at school.

Instead, this money can be spent on encouraging children to take up sports at a young age.To what extent do you agree or disagree?\n\nScore this IELTS Task 2 essay according to the rubric, ensuring alignment with the question:\n\nInvesting in sports is an important part of the government’s business to improve the physical fitness of the population, particularly young children. While it is necessary to train a few selected individuals to compete in major world sporting events, the government should do more to provide young people with plenty of fun activities. There are a myriad of benefits to be gained from funding sports participation at grass-root levels and excellence in performance at elite levels.\nTo begin with, to motivate children to be physically fit, they should be physically active with a lot of fun at grass-root levels, and the key is investing in a variety of sports facilities.  Whatever their fitness personality, all young children can be physically fit through enjoying regular exercise, if only for the fun of it..  Generally speaking, if children start doing sports early enough, they will come to regard physical activity as a normal—and fun—part of everyday routine. The point is keeping the focus on fun because young children will not do something they do not enjoy.  If they enjoy a sport, they will do more of it; on the contrary, if they do not, they may be bored and frustrated and therefore reluctant to exercise. This shows why money should be spent on giving fun opportunities to children who begin taking up sports at an early age.\nAt elite levels, it is not a waste of money when it comes to preparing competitors in major world sporting events because athletes are allowed to experience the winning spirit of competition on the global stage. For that matter, every government has a duty to spend money on helping its people fulfill their potential, and such events as the Olympics and World Cup can give athletes a goal and young people a chance to believe in themselves. At this point, the question arises about the wisdom of a country (with limited resources) spending too much money and not getting a good return on investment, suggesting that this money should be put elsewhere instead. Although the answer to the question depends on who you ask, there is evidence that investing in elite athletes is gaining support from a country’s people who like to see their stars shining in international competitions.

Discuss both views and give your opinion.\n\nScore this IELTS Task 2 essay according to the rubric, ensuring alignment with the question:\n\nNowadays, we are living in the world where problem of studying and working after high schools is a heated topic and usually discussed. People have varying views about this issue. While some people advocate getting a job after graduating high school, I would argue that the optimal way to be successful in their career is going to university.\n\nThe option to skip college is justifiable because it is attractive for several reasons. Many young people want to earn money as soon as possible. In this way, they can become independent and they will be able to afford their own house or start a family. In terms of their race, young people who decide to find work, rather than continue their studies, may  progress more quickly. They will have the chance to gain real experience and learn practical skills related to their chosen profession. This may lead to promotions and a successful career.\nOn the other hand, I believe that it is more beneficial for students to continue their tertiary education. Firstly, academic qualifications are required in many professions. For example, it is impossible to become a lawyer, doctor and teacher without having the relevant degree. As a result, university graduates help people to have access to more and better job opportunities, and they tend to earn a lucrative income than those with fewer qualifications. Secondly, the job market is becoming increasingly competitive, and sometimes there are hundreds of applicants for one position in a big company. Young people who do not have qualifications from a university will not be able to compete. \n\nFor the reasons mentioned above, it seems to me that attending colleges and universities plays an indispensable role in realizing a successful race.\n\nProvide your assessment in the specified JSON format."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"per_criterion\": [{\"name\": \"Task Response\", \"band\": 7.5, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"Nowadays, we are living in the world where problem of studying and working after high schools is a heated topic and usually discussed\", \"This may lead to promotions and a successful career\", \"For the reasons mentioned above, it seems to me that attending colleges and universities plays an indispensable role in realizing a successful race\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"Nowadays, we are living in the world where problem of studying and working after high schools is a h\", \"type\": \"task\", \"fix\": \"Consider improving the task response aspect here.\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Develop your main arguments more fully with specific examples.\", \"Ensure you address all parts of the question directly.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Coherence & Cohesion\", \"band\": 6.5, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"Nowadays, we are living in the world where problem of studying and working after high schools is a heated topic and usually discussed\", \"This may lead to promotions and a successful career\", \"For the reasons mentioned above, it seems to me that attending colleges and universities plays an indispensable role in realizing a successful race\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"Nowadays, we are living in the world where problem of studying and working after high schools is a h\", \"type\": \"coherence\", \"fix\": \"Consider improving the coherence & cohesion aspect here.\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Use more varied linking words to connect your ideas.\", \"Improve paragraph structure with clearer topic sentences.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Lexical Resource\", \"band\": 6.5, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"Nowadays, we are living in the world where problem of studying and working after high schools is a heated topic and usually discussed\", \"This may lead to promotions and a successful career\", \"For the reasons mentioned above, it seems to me that attending colleges and universities plays an indispensable role in realizing a successful race\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"Nowadays, we are living in the world where problem of studying and working after high schools is a h\", \"type\": \"lexical\", \"fix\": \"Consider improving the lexical resource aspect here.\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Use more sophisticated vocabulary and avoid repetition.\", \"Focus on precise word choice and natural collocations.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Grammatical Range & Accuracy\", \"band\": 7.5, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"Nowadays, we are living in the world where problem of studying and working after high schools is a heated topic and usually discussed\", \"This may lead to promotions and a successful career\", \"For the reasons mentioned above, it seems to me that attending colleges and universities plays an indispensable role in realizing a successful race\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"Nowadays, we are living in the world where problem of studying and working after high schools is a h\", \"type\": \"grammar\", \"fix\": \"Consider improving the grammatical range & accuracy aspect here.\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Use more complex sentence structures.\", \"Check for grammatical errors and improve accuracy.\"]}], \"overall\": 7.0}"}]}

Discuss both views and give your own opinion.\n\nScore this IELTS Task 2 essay according to the rubric, ensuring alignment with the question:\n\nAlthough some people believe that the aim of museums is to entertain people and give them joy, others say that museums should be educational. In my opinion, a museum should be both entertaining and educational.\r\n\r\nOn the one hand, it is said that museums should be entertaining. This is because if museums put emphasis on entertainment, many families may be encouraged to spend their free time by going to museums rather than doing a useless activity like watching TV. For example, holding some games in museums can be an effective way to attract visitors, and bring joy to them. However, emphasizing on education can turn museums to a boring place, as a result of which this monotony may put the public off going to exhibitions. \r\n\r\nOn the other hand, others hold the view that museums should be educational. Firstly, because these places should broaden visitors’ horizons about their local culture and history. By following this way, it is highly unlikely for a country’s culture and background to be forgotten as museums act as reminder and help visitors to remember the history and customs of their community. For instance, putting some paintings about the ancestors of a country on display can help local people to remember parts of their history. Secondly, since museums are open to the public of all age groups they should take advantage of this opportunity and educate visitors so as to solve many problems. For instance, environmental issues can be addressed if people are taught how to reuse their stuff. \r\n\r\nIn conclusion.

As a result,we have become victim's to lazieness.This has caused chronic disease. Such as, Diabetes, Hypertension etc. Additionally, we spend more money in buying these home appliances and their maintenance. One clear example is electrical stove,It costs more to buy as compared to cooking on wood.\n\nTo conclude, I strongly believe that mechanical devices have taken over alot of our daily house work and that has helped us in saving our precious time.Moreover,It has also made our life simpler and more reliable.In Addition,this has brought comfort to our house by eliminating the hard work and attention that was once a required to complete the job by hand.  \n\n\nProvide your assessment in the specified JSON format."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"per_criterion\": [{\"name\": \"Task Response\", \"band\": 4.5, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"A lot of tasks at the house were accomplished by hands, Majority of them have now been taken over by machinery\", \"As a result,we have become victim's to lazieness\", \"In Addition,this has brought comfort to our house by eliminating the hard work and attention that was once a required to complete the job by hand\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"A lot of tasks at the house were accomplished by hands, Majority of them have now been taken over by\", \"type\": \"task\", \"fix\": \"Consider improving the task response aspect here.\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Develop your main arguments more fully with specific examples.\", \"Ensure you address all parts of the question directly.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Coherence & Cohesion\", \"band\": 3.5, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"A lot of tasks at the house were accomplished by hands, Majority of them have now been taken over by machinery\", \"As a result,we have become victim's to lazieness\", \"In Addition,this has brought comfort to our house by eliminating the hard work and attention that was once a required to complete the job by hand\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"A lot of tasks at the house were accomplished by hands, Majority of them have now been taken over by\", \"type\": \"coherence\", \"fix\": \"Consider improving the coherence & cohesion aspect here.\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Use more varied linking words to connect your ideas.\", \"Improve paragraph structure with clearer topic sentences.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Lexical Resource\", \"band\": 3.5, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"A lot of tasks at the house were accomplished by hands, Majority of them have now been taken over by machinery\", \"As a result,we have become victim's to lazieness\", \"In Addition,this has brought comfort to our house by eliminating the hard work and attention that was once a required to complete the job by hand\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"A lot of tasks at the house were accomplished by hands, Majority of them have now been taken over by\", \"type\": \"lexical\", \"fix\": \"Consider improving the lexical resource aspect here.\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Use more sophisticated vocabulary and avoid repetition.\", \"Focus on precise word choice and natural collocations.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Grammatical Range & Accuracy\", \"band\": 4.5, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"A lot of tasks at the house were accomplished by hands, Majority of them have now been taken over by machinery\", \"As a result,we have become victim's to lazieness\", \"In Addition,this has brought comfort to our house by eliminating the hard work and attention that was once a required to complete the job by hand\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"A lot of tasks at the house were accomplished by hands, Majority of them have now been taken over by\", \"type\": \"grammar\", \"fix\": \"Consider improving the grammatical range & accuracy aspect here.\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Use more complex sentence structures.\", \"Check for grammatical errors and improve accuracy.\"]}], \"overall\": 4.0}"}]}
