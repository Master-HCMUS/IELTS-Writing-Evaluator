Also,they can share everything with each other including personal matters without any kind of shyness,moreover, young students learn easily and faster due to peer pressure which help in their academics. For instance, according to the survey of 'Times of Japan' 90% school school students perform better because they study with their same age friends during the lockdown period. This happens because students who are shy in class,they feel free to ask anything with their friends.\r\n\r\nHowever, sometimes things goes wrong and the reason is peer pressure because sometimes youngest join wrong group as a consequence,they lost right track.

This essay delves into both views before deriving a stance.\r\n\r\nOn the one hand, in the present paradigm shift, people seem to be more health-conscious than in the past days. As a result, these health clubs and game centres have become the order of the day. Primarily, the consumption of unhealthy packaged food and, the strenuous work culture have been made the individuals vulnerable to various lifestyle diseases. Consequently, to enhance the depleted energy society like to opt for these advancements for the betterment.  More importantly, many folks, do not have the space or access to equipment, utilize these opportunities to tackle the body related  menaces.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, those who argue against these advancements hold valid points to be considered. As such, the ill-health and  stress could not be alleviated with these infrastructures, unless citizens follow a healthy way of life. Has there been a safe distance from soft drinks and fast foods, there would have been a sustainable health model. Furthermore, rather than spending too much money on these facilities, it could be used for improved medical assistance and social awareness of health. Ultimately, not the centre provides to aid for the sound fitness but the individual himself neesed to bother it.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, notwithstanding some benefits from sports settlements, it does not play any vital role on a group of people.

Personally, I think that cutting edge technologies have already reduced manpower in several sectors and inevitably AI technologies will reign all sectors regardless of job types. The aim of this essay is to discuss the argument and it will explain by using relevant examples.\r\n\r\nTo begin with, it is important to bear in mind that the failure rate which is made by humans can be reduced with artificially intelligent robots. In this way, the standardization of products can be provided and this means that factories and industry are able to produce their product at a standard level of quality. Furthermore, there is no doubt that AI robots can make the same process in a shorter time and more accurately when compared to manpower. For instance, AI robots have started to be used in surgeries and as a consequence of it,  human mistakes can be declined and also the reliability of operation had increased. \r\n\r\nSecondly,  breakthrough innovations in the machine learning field show that these technologies can be used in every area, even the arts. Many people thought that machines and AI would never generate art and craft works 20 years ago. Contrary to this belief, people have shown that everything is possible with the development of AI and they have been starting to think about why it can not be replaced with all jobs in the future. For example, with the GAN technologies, new paintings and artworks can be produced by using deep neural networks. Consequently, this revolution showed that machine learning and artificial intelligence technologies can be replaced with all jobs in the future, even the unpredictable ones such as painting, writing poems and novels. \r\n\r\nTo summarize,  although plenty of individuals thought that AI and machine learning technologies can not be used for many purposes such as arts and crafts, artificial intelligent developments showed that everything can be possible in the computer ages.

Although the advent of technology can make people's life complicated, it has increasingly played a remarkable role in our daily life.\r\n\r\nOn one hand, those people who argue technology can bring about complex possibilities to current life may offer certain convincing reasons. First of all, usage of technological products tends to cause squander an individual's time and energy. In other words, one needs to learn how to utilize them properly and fix the broken parts. It is quite difficult and tough for people to perform that, especially for the elderly and young children. Thus, these behaviours can waste time to some extent. In addition, it is likely that online activities contribute to a lack of security and financial loss. For example, It is personal information typed during online surfing that allows hackers to use it illegally. \r\n\r\nOn the other hand, technological improvements have provided us with great convenience and simplification. Firstly, some high-tech products extremely help people to do routine tasks, such as automatic washing machine and rice cooker, which might free hands from stifling housework and boost life efficiency. Secondly, the telecommunication tools are beneficial to cultivate bonded and imitate relationships. This means that mobile phones and video chats enable students who study abroad to communicate with their parents and friends immediately without spending much time on commuting to post office and waiting for replies. Therefore, technology is potential to maintain a closer connection with other people.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, technology alters people's life to become simple and enhance live standards, but there are certain counterproductive impacts on quality of life.

Others argue that it would be better if these countries can spend the money on children to take part in sports. To what extent do you agree or disagree?\n\nScore this IELTS Task 2 essay according to the rubric, ensuring alignment with the question:\n\nSports has been a debatable perspective in this day and age. While some people assume that it is of the tremendous benefit of investing in encouraging national competitors to participate in international competitions, others think that it is of importance to allocate money to children to attend sports. From my point of view, both children and professional athletes should receive an equal investment.\r\n\r\nOn the one hand, having attendants at cross-bordered competitions can have great impacts on a country’s economy. Since these games are held worldwide, which means they have influences on a mass scale, by gaining triumph, the image of them as well as the country they represent is dispersed widely among people from all over the world, attracting a wealth of foreign investors. For example, a large amount of money has been injected into Vietnam by Korean sponsors since Vietnam’s national football team attained silver medals in the AFC cup. Therefore, it is of the essence to have citizens, who are on behalf of their country, taking part in international sports contests.  \r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the government should also concentrate on developing sports internal infrastructures to draw more teenagers playing sports as it is crucial for the growth of a nation. Since children in this digital age spend 5-6 hours a day on watching tv, they are prone to suffer from some diseases such as cancers, which deters them from fully joint labour markets in the future and can become a burden for society. In contrast, if they engage in sports activities, they may potentially grow with strong health to accomplish their jobs and contribute to the national economy. Hence, funding sports to kindle youngsters’ interest in sports might bring a myriad of advantages for a nation.  \r\n\r\nTo sum up, it is indisputable that authorities should financially assist sports players to enroll in worldwide contests since they can attract a lot of sponsors.

This essay will discuss the  cause and solution of this issue which affects  everyone around the globe.\n\nTo begin with, the advertisement has already brought tremendous change in all walks of human life. Companies create these advertisements to spread awareness of their products among their customers. Moreover, day by day numerous companies sell the same product with various offers to consumers which led to confusion and distraction among the customer. For instance, a student while browsing on the internet to get information related to their assignment gets distracted by pop-up advertisements which attract them to look into the products and is unwilling to force them to buy those products. According to a survey conducted by Nepal Economic Forum they came to know that consumers are frustrated with the increasing number of advertisements which are shown on T.V and on the Internet.\n\nIn the contrast, it is a widespread concern around the globe through  consumer gets distracted from these unwanted advertisements which appear in between their work. In order to avoid this kind of activities consumer should use an alternative browser such as brave which will automatically block advertisements on a plethora of websites. Furthermore, the government should investigate the product that is displayed on websites, on TV and the billboard, regarding their quality. For example,  baby milk powder  contains harmful chemicals and thus led to food poison in babies.\n\nTo conclude, showing advertisements is beneficial to consumers as they spread awareness among the customer for their new products but it should be done in a way that does not affect  people.

While many individuals suppose that these individuals should accept that due to their considerable fame, I hold the opposite viewpoint.\r\n\r\nIt is undeniable that some individuals who work as celebrities, such as actors, models, etc., suffer from the pressure of society on their professional and personal lifestyles. The media enterprises do this to obtain more notoriety and ratings for their prestigious companies. Therefore, they frequently invade their privacy by highlighting terrible circumstances in front of the public, which is considered a disgraceful act.

Thus, the unduplicated individual has the right to live and do everything they enjoy without breaking the law.

For example, actor Tran Thanh, the films he has made have made great contributions to Vietnam's cinema, not only attracting the attention of domestic but also international audiences. Consequently, he can use the revenue to do charitable activities and assist the poor with problems they have encountered in their lives.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, I believe that should respect and understand that everyone, including celebrities, is entitled to privacy and personal space.

That is caused for two main reasons that I am going to explain in this essay and also give some solutions.\r\n\r\nFirstly, the main reason for this situation is the rising population living in the world. Every day the amount of earth's population is dramatically growing, especially, with the constant evolution in the field of medicine. Because of that people's life expectancy is rising and there is always a need for new houses and roads to be built, since more and more people are using cars to move around. \r\n\r\nMoreover, with economic development someone could be more easily able to afford a car, which may be more convenient for them to get to their work instead of using a bus. \r\n\r\nTo solve this problem the governments should promote and develop more public transportation, since in that way more people can avoid using the roads in their own vehicles. For example, the underground and overground trains are a very sufficient way to complete many crowd's needs to move around instead of taking a bus or a car. Furthermore, the trains have their own railways and during their stops they don't interfere with the street.\r\n\r\nIn addition, one other action is to upgrade the existing roads so that more means of transport can be used in the same driveway. For instance, creating more lanes is a smart plan to lower traffic.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, it is a political decision to educate nation in order to change habits and needs a solid political will to create a better world for everyone.\n\nProvide your assessment in the specified JSON format."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"per_criterion\": [{\"name\": \"Task Response\", \"band\": 5.5, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"Traffic is an increasing problem nowadays, in many countries and towns around the globe\", \"To solve this problem the governments should promote and develop more public transportation, since in that way more people can avoid using the roads in their own vehicles\", \"In conclusion, it is a political decision to educate nation in order to change habits and needs a solid political will to create a better world for everyone\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"Traffic is an increasing problem nowadays, in many countries and towns around the globe\", \"type\": \"task\", \"fix\": \"Consider improving the task response aspect here.\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Develop your main arguments more fully with specific examples.\", \"Ensure you address all parts of the question directly.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Coherence & Cohesion\", \"band\": 4.5, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"Traffic is an increasing problem nowadays, in many countries and towns around the globe\", \"To solve this problem the governments should promote and develop more public transportation, since in that way more people can avoid using the roads in their own vehicles\", \"In conclusion, it is a political decision to educate nation in order to change habits and needs a solid political will to create a better world for everyone\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"Traffic is an increasing problem nowadays, in many countries and towns around the globe\", \"type\": \"coherence\", \"fix\": \"Consider improving the coherence & cohesion aspect here.\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Use more varied linking words to connect your ideas.\", \"Improve paragraph structure with clearer topic sentences.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Lexical Resource\", \"band\": 4.5, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"Traffic is an increasing problem nowadays, in many countries and towns around the globe\", \"To solve this problem the governments should promote and develop more public transportation, since in that way more people can avoid using the roads in their own vehicles\", \"In conclusion, it is a political decision to educate nation in order to change habits and needs a solid political will to create a better world for everyone\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"Traffic is an increasing problem nowadays, in many countries and towns around the globe\", \"type\": \"lexical\", \"fix\": \"Consider improving the lexical resource aspect here.\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Use more sophisticated vocabulary and avoid repetition.\", \"Focus on precise word choice and natural collocations.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Grammatical Range & Accuracy\", \"band\": 5.5, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"Traffic is an increasing problem nowadays, in many countries and towns around the globe\", \"To solve this problem the governments should promote and develop more public transportation, since in that way more people can avoid using the roads in their own vehicles\", \"In conclusion, it is a political decision to educate nation in order to change habits and needs a solid political will to create a better world for everyone\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"Traffic is an increasing problem nowadays, in many countries and towns around the globe\", \"type\": \"grammar\", \"fix\": \"Consider improving the grammatical range & accuracy aspect here.\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Use more complex sentence structures.\", \"Check for grammatical errors and improve accuracy.\"]}], \"overall\": 5.0, \"votes\": [5.0, 5.0, 5.0], \"dispersion\": 0.0, \"confidence\": \"high\", \"meta\": {\"prompt_hash\": \"training_data\", \"model\": \"training\", \"schema_version\": \"v1\", \"rubric_version\": \"rubric/v1\", \"token_usage\": {\"input_tokens\": 303, \"output_tokens\": 500}}}"}]}

Do you agree or disagree? Why?\n\nScore this IELTS Task 2 essay according to the rubric, ensuring alignment with the question:\n\nIn the present, huge public green areas are currently replaced by several buildings in the cities, since people do not give  importance to those spaces. Nevertheless, some people believe that having public locations do not create as many benefits for people and society as having buildings for business activities. From my point of view, public spaces should be built because of numerous reasons.\r\n\r\nFirst of all, creating squares improves the mental and physical health of people. For the mental side, it assists people to alleviate stress, since they can have more time to make a long conversation about their problems and lives with their peers and families. Moreover, it strengthens relationships among families and friends, and make individuals relax and enjoy their life as they spend time on activities such as picnics and playing sports. Furthermore, they have a chance to meet strangers to share perspectives and experiences, helping them to have inspirations or new ideas. In terms of physical strength, establishing squares or green places encourage people to play sport or exercise. For instance, people can create sports clubs such as yoga and gather at the park.\r\n\r\nSecondly, governments can use squares or parks to support careers in special fields and local populations to generate income. To clarify, the ministry can launch a campaign to promote art or music by allowing a group of artists to establish exhibitions or clubs to attract interested crowds and gain revenue. In addition, the governments can encourage locals by creating markets, events and concerts, so local people will have opportunities to sell local products and tickets, and can also attract tourists to travel towns to gain more income. \r\n\r\nIn conclusion, creating public areas provides numerous advantages to an individual and families as it helps people to relieve mental well-being, and enhance physical fitness.

Some assert that the family is the primary influence, while others argue that friends, music, and movies play more significant roles. In this essay, I will explore both perspectives, discussing how families shape children and considering the impact of external influences.\r\n\r\nOn one hand, families play a crucial role in the growth of their kids as primary caregivers and mentors. For instance, parents who actively encourage a child's curiosity and nurture critical thinking significantly contribute to their intellectual growth. Additionally, when parents model positive behaviours like kindness and cooperation, these actions help them understand and adopt essential societal norms. These early lessons not only impact their current behaviour but also establish a foundation for future decision-making. In essence, the family serves as a cornerstone in fostering not just the child's immediate well-being but also their long-term growth.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, external factors like movies, music, and friends wield considerable influence over a youngster's thoughts and behaviours. The lyrics of songs and the content of films, encountered by nearly all youngsters, shape their perspectives and understanding of the world. For example, exposure to melody with positive messages or films that promote empathy can contribute to their emotional development. Furthermore, the influence of friends should not be underestimated. Friendships often involve shared experiences and fun, significantly contributing to their mindset. Children engaging in dynamic and friendly environments may develop essential qualities like open-mindedness, adaptability, and teamwork, which are valuable beyond the confines of the family setting. In this way, external influences, including media and peer interactions, play a vital part in shaping their worldview and social skills.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, while many children are initially shaped by their families, others are influenced by their surroundings.

What is your opinion?\n\nScore this IELTS Task 2 essay according to the rubric, ensuring alignment with the question:\n\nSome people believe that eventually all jobs will be done by artificially intelligent robots. What is your opinion?\r\n\r\n  Robots are rising nowadays; it might be true that some robots will replace human jobs in the future. But in my opinion, some jobs cannot be replaced by robots. In this article, I will discuss why some manual work cannot be replaced by machines.\r\n\r\n  In my opinion, some jobs cannot be taken the place of androids. Because they require human skills like creativity, subjective judgement and so forth. For example, a childcare expert. A childcare expert is a job which provides children with the education and training they need. But robots cannot treat children or babies like humans because they do not have an imagination or the ability to own assessment. Human communication is the need for infants to learn and grow. Therefore, mechanoids may not think like human beings and cannot replace human beings.\r\n\r\n  On the other hand, robots will not take over humans. Since humankind prefers to talk with mankind. For instance, when we go to the shopping centre, and want to ask something we don’t know or don’t understand, we will go to the information desk and ask for help.

A lot of reasons may lead to this trend but probably it is mainly because of curiosity and refurbishment. To find out more detail about their homes, asking elderlies who live in the same neighbours and checking  documents would be effective ways. \r\n\r\nFirstly, some people have a deep motivation to delve into the past of their houses because of curiosity.\r\n\r\n Many buildings in Europe were used for alternative purposes during the second world war like medical centres, shelters and military centre. Hence, people would like to learn detailed information about their homes to clarify whether they offered a place for such purposes or not. Furthermore, historical buildings demand regular refurbishment to maintain living properly. When it comes to infrastructural issues, having a plan or information about the home would be an exact remedy without damaging the building. \r\n\r\nOne of the most effective ways to find out knowledge about the history of the home is to get in touch with elderly people who are likely to remember of location's history. They generally live in the same area for long years and have a variety of memories. Likewise, In some countries, libraries stock documents about local people or buildings. With access to the library, citizens can research the history of the building they live in depth. \r\n\r\nIn conclusion, Nowadays, many people become interested in the history of the building they live in.

To what extent do you agree or disagree?\n\nScore this IELTS Task 2 essay according to the rubric, ensuring alignment with the question:\n\nAdvertising and its influences have long been a topic of numerous debates, especially in recent years. In this regard, some people argue that the impact of advertisements on shoppers is neglectable. However, in contrast, the majority number of people including me hold the view that advertisements could channel the shoppers' choices in an effective way. In the forthcoming paragraphs, I will support this point of view with likely explanations.\r\n\r\nTo begin with, it is widely accepted that the modern human is leading a consumerism lifestyle due to indulging in social media platforms and being bombarded with commercials offering an excessive range of products. This means that huge enterprises meticulously target individuals, particularly younger consumers, with impressive adverts on social media platforms such as Instagram and Telegram. As a result, this level of omnipresence of new products with gimmick options makes it inevitable for young people who spend most of their time surfing the internet. The latest statistics in the UK, for instance, have demonstrated that nearly 60% of people who spend a certain time on the internet buy at least one or two items every month under the direct influence of online advertisements. \r\n\r\nFurthermore, the fact advertisements could be functional in terms of making customers aware of various features, options and models of available products in the market. Thanks to the informative form of adverts, people have an opportunity to compare different items they need in terms of prices and features to make the best decision, which would have not been possible otherwise. This trend is quite beneficial for both individuals and companies as it increases sale figures and boost the economy in society. Apart from that, driven by advertisements, the time devoted to shopping sprees has diminished substantially due to the fact that before attending the malls or shops people exactly know which items and brands they want to purchase. For example, when I have to buy a mobile phone I  do not waste my time in the shop since, thanks to the adverts and pops on the Internet, I am already familiar with the exact features, costs and quality of every available smartphone in the market which makes the process of buying in the shop significantly lower.\r\n\r\nTo sum up, despite the fact that a minority group of people do not trust adverts anyway, in my opinion, most people, especially younger ones are affected by advertisements since not only it could enhance their knowledge about different goods but also  can stimulate demand

However,others find it an undesirable and negative move, as it may cause disrespect of teachers and indiscipline in the classroom. Even though  asking doubts without hesitation can somewhere prove troublesome, I completely loud its overall advantages and favour it.\r\n\r\nOn the one hand, the freedom of clearing the questions of scholars sometimes creates undue disturbance and distraction in the study room. This is because, lobbies of non-serious students are more likely to put unimportant queries for the sake of creating humour, as they are aware that their educators are bound to respond. Above all, chances are greater that they can put wrong allegations on their educators for not satisfying their doubts if they have had any record of punishment. One such case surfaced in Calcutta when,according to FIR,our teacher committed suicide as he was harassed and disrespected by his learners for not being capable of using a smart class screen.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, I feel that questioning is the basic right of education. Undoubtedly, when anyone learns something, he is more likely to be sceptical about certain facts which can only be eradicated by asking more and more.Thus, suffice to say, being vocal during class time bills confidence which further leads to success. Secondly, interrogation helps strengthen the bond between educatees and tutors. Since students' involvement motivates the lecturer to go beyond their limitations, it proves that the speaker is being heard and understood. So, in a way, in order to build a healthy relationship, learners ought to be liberal in putting questions while studying time. \r\n\r\nIn conclusion, despite having some chances of arguments and negativity in the classroom, scholars should be free to reveal their problems in front of their tutors due to fact that it gives them the opportunity to learn profoundly and boosts their self-esteem.\n\nProvide your assessment in the specified JSON format."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"per_criterion\": [{\"name\": \"Task Response\", \"band\": 6.5, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"It is believed by some that learners should be taught to raise their concerns and criticize while learning in order to upgrade the educational system\", \"On the other hand, I feel that questioning is the basic right of education\", \"In conclusion, despite having some chances of arguments and negativity in the classroom, scholars should be free to reveal their problems in front of their tutors due to fact that it gives them the opportunity to learn profoundly and boosts their self-esteem\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"It is believed by some that learners should be taught to raise their concerns and criticize while le\", \"type\": \"task\", \"fix\": \"Consider improving the task response aspect here.\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Develop your main arguments more fully with specific examples.\", \"Ensure you address all parts of the question directly.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Coherence & Cohesion\", \"band\": 5.5, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"It is believed by some that learners should be taught to raise their concerns and criticize while learning in order to upgrade the educational system\", \"On the other hand, I feel that questioning is the basic right of education\", \"In conclusion, despite having some chances of arguments and negativity in the classroom, scholars should be free to reveal their problems in front of their tutors due to fact that it gives them the opportunity to learn profoundly and boosts their self-esteem\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"It is believed by some that learners should be taught to raise their concerns and criticize while le\", \"type\": \"coherence\", \"fix\": \"Consider improving the coherence & cohesion aspect here.\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Use more varied linking words to connect your ideas.\", \"Improve paragraph structure with clearer topic sentences.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Lexical Resource\", \"band\": 5.5, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"It is believed by some that learners should be taught to raise their concerns and criticize while learning in order to upgrade the educational system\", \"On the other hand, I feel that questioning is the basic right of education\", \"In conclusion, despite having some chances of arguments and negativity in the classroom, scholars should be free to reveal their problems in front of their tutors due to fact that it gives them the opportunity to learn profoundly and boosts their self-esteem\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"It is believed by some that learners should be taught to raise their concerns and criticize while le\", \"type\": \"lexical\", \"fix\": \"Consider improving the lexical resource aspect here.\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Use more sophisticated vocabulary and avoid repetition.\", \"Focus on precise word choice and natural collocations.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Grammatical Range & Accuracy\", \"band\": 6.5, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"It is believed by some that learners should be taught to raise their concerns and criticize while learning in order to upgrade the educational system\", \"On the other hand, I feel that questioning is the basic right of education\", \"In conclusion, despite having some chances of arguments and negativity in the classroom, scholars should be free to reveal their problems in front of their tutors due to fact that it gives them the opportunity to learn profoundly and boosts their self-esteem\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"It is believed by some that learners should be taught to raise their concerns and criticize while le\", \"type\": \"grammar\", \"fix\": \"Consider improving the grammatical range & accuracy aspect here.\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Use more complex sentence structures.\", \"Check for grammatical errors and improve accuracy.\"]}], \"overall\": 6.0, \"votes\": [6.0, 6.0, 6.0], \"dispersion\": 0.0, \"confidence\": \"high\", \"meta\": {\"prompt_hash\": \"training_data\", \"model\": \"training\", \"schema_version\": \"v1\", \"rubric_version\": \"rubric/v1\", \"token_usage\": {\"input_tokens\": 372, \"output_tokens\": 500}}}"}]}

While, this school of thought is valid to some extent based on reducing the number of vehicles and alleviating the exploitation of fossil fuel, I am of the opinion that there are several ways to solve environmental problems besides that measure related to rules and public awareness. \r\n\r\nThere are a variety of compelling reasons why higher fuel costs can deal with environmental problems. Firstly, this method may decrease fuel vehicle usage and ownership. If the price of fuel, which is needed for cars to activate, people tend to swift to transportation that requires less fuel such as buses or bicycles. In 2022, many surveys have indicated that since the cost of fuel peaked after 20 years due to the war, the rate of people taking public transportation and riding bicycles increased. Secondly, higher fuel charges might lessen the exploitation. When rising the fuel price, many companies lost their interest in  investing in the process of utilizing fossil fuel. Therefore, fewer and fewer minerals may be made use of and also devoted to preserving the variety of the world's minerals. \r\n\r\nDespite the aforementioned benefits, I believe that some other measures can be adopted to address ecological issues. One primary approach is  raising public awareness. Government can organise presentations and events to tell the community what problems can result from deteriorating environment. Protecting the environment is not only a duty of administrations but also the public as a whole. Moreover, authorities can impose regulations to improve waste treatment and reduce pollution. They can expand the landfills and waste disposal of factories and civilizations, hence several types of pollution such as air and water are eased. \r\n\r\nIn conclusion, while some claim that a higher fuel fee is the ideal method to solve ecological problems based on lessening  fossil fuel usage and exploitation, it seems to me that other measures can be utilized such as  increasing societal consciousness and implementing rules to limit pollution.\n\nProvide your assessment in the specified JSON format."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"per_criterion\": [{\"name\": \"Task Response\", \"band\": 5.0, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"It is prevalent for people to opine that increasing fuel prices for vehicles is the best way to address environmental issues\", \"Therefore, fewer and fewer minerals may be made use of and also devoted to preserving the variety of the world's minerals\", \"In conclusion, while some claim that a higher fuel fee is the ideal method to solve ecological problems based on lessening  fossil fuel usage and exploitation, it seems to me that other measures can be utilized such as  increasing societal consciousness and implementing rules to limit pollution\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"It is prevalent for people to opine that increasing fuel prices for vehicles is the best way to addr\", \"type\": \"task\", \"fix\": \"Consider improving the task response aspect here.\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Develop your main arguments more fully with specific examples.\", \"Ensure you address all parts of the question directly.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Coherence & Cohesion\", \"band\": 4.0, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"It is prevalent for people to opine that increasing fuel prices for vehicles is the best way to address environmental issues\", \"Therefore, fewer and fewer minerals may be made use of and also devoted to preserving the variety of the world's minerals\", \"In conclusion, while some claim that a higher fuel fee is the ideal method to solve ecological problems based on lessening  fossil fuel usage and exploitation, it seems to me that other measures can be utilized such as  increasing societal consciousness and implementing rules to limit pollution\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"It is prevalent for people to opine that increasing fuel prices for vehicles is the best way to addr\", \"type\": \"coherence\", \"fix\": \"Consider improving the coherence & cohesion aspect here.\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Use more varied linking words to connect your ideas.\", \"Improve paragraph structure with clearer topic sentences.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Lexical Resource\", \"band\": 4.0, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"It is prevalent for people to opine that increasing fuel prices for vehicles is the best way to address environmental issues\", \"Therefore, fewer and fewer minerals may be made use of and also devoted to preserving the variety of the world's minerals\", \"In conclusion, while some claim that a higher fuel fee is the ideal method to solve ecological problems based on lessening  fossil fuel usage and exploitation, it seems to me that other measures can be utilized such as  increasing societal consciousness and implementing rules to limit pollution\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"It is prevalent for people to opine that increasing fuel prices for vehicles is the best way to addr\", \"type\": \"lexical\", \"fix\": \"Consider improving the lexical resource aspect here.\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Use more sophisticated vocabulary and avoid repetition.\", \"Focus on precise word choice and natural collocations.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Grammatical Range & Accuracy\", \"band\": 5.0, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"It is prevalent for people to opine that increasing fuel prices for vehicles is the best way to address environmental issues\", \"Therefore, fewer and fewer minerals may be made use of and also devoted to preserving the variety of the world's minerals\", \"In conclusion, while some claim that a higher fuel fee is the ideal method to solve ecological problems based on lessening  fossil fuel usage and exploitation, it seems to me that other measures can be utilized such as  increasing societal consciousness and implementing rules to limit pollution\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"It is prevalent for people to opine that increasing fuel prices for vehicles is the best way to addr\", \"type\": \"grammar\", \"fix\": \"Consider improving the grammatical range & accuracy aspect here.\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Use more complex sentence structures.\", \"Check for grammatical errors and improve accuracy.\"]}], \"overall\": 4.5, \"votes\": [4.5, 4.5, 4.5], \"dispersion\": 0.0, \"confidence\": \"high\", \"meta\": {\"prompt_hash\": \"training_data\", \"model\": \"training\", \"schema_version\": \"v1\", \"rubric_version\": \"rubric/v1\", \"token_usage\": {\"input_tokens\": 370, \"output_tokens\": 500}}}"}]}

Although this way could be associated with some benefits, I believe that the government should implement better alternatives to tackle the problem\r\n\r\nAdmittedly, educating criminals in prisons could be beneficial for alleviating the crime rate. For one thing, education for offenders in prison provides them some fundamental knowledge to pursue higher education programs and may change their awareness. Countries such as Singapore, where to allow prisoners to study during the execution of the sentence, regularly have the lowest crime rate among the parts of the world. For another, offering a learning program in prisons for criminals could be regarded as a way of assisting them to get a job after release from prison.

This is particularly important, especially when offenders re-assimilate into society and therefore prevent recidivism effectively.\r\n\r\nHowever, there are some reasons why education could not be considered as a proper measure for offenders during their time in prison. Firstly, such a form of education is offered for those who engage in wrongful acts, and therefore this could diminish the crime level to a certain extent. Instead, equipping students with crime knowledge in school will help shape crime prevention thinking and awareness for students, which will significantly reduce crime rates in the long term. Secondly, for some criminals who could not change their minds by educating, harsh punishment or even serving longer sentences would be better. Indeed, for some white-collar crimes who have highly educated and high positions in society, such as lawyers or doctors, there is no point in educating them rather than implementing a policy of zero tolerance.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, it seems to me that although educating inmates in prison is an optimal way to reduce the crime level, it is not the best solution, as there are more feasible methods that could help such as imposing severe punishments and equipping students with crime knowledge\n\nProvide your assessment in the specified JSON format."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"per_criterion\": [{\"name\": \"Task Response\", \"band\": 7.5, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"Many said that educating inmates in prison is the most effective method to reduce the crime levels\", \"This is particularly important, especially when offenders re-assimilate into society and therefore prevent recidivism effectively\", \"In conclusion, it seems to me that although educating inmates in prison is an optimal way to reduce the crime level, it is not the best solution, as there are more feasible methods that could help such as imposing severe punishments and equipping students with crime knowledge\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"Many said that educating inmates in prison is the most effective method to reduce the crime levels\", \"type\": \"task\", \"fix\": \"Consider improving the task response aspect here.\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Develop your main arguments more fully with specific examples.\", \"Ensure you address all parts of the question directly.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Coherence & Cohesion\", \"band\": 6.5, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"Many said that educating inmates in prison is the most effective method to reduce the crime levels\", \"This is particularly important, especially when offenders re-assimilate into society and therefore prevent recidivism effectively\", \"In conclusion, it seems to me that although educating inmates in prison is an optimal way to reduce the crime level, it is not the best solution, as there are more feasible methods that could help such as imposing severe punishments and equipping students with crime knowledge\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"Many said that educating inmates in prison is the most effective method to reduce the crime levels\", \"type\": \"coherence\", \"fix\": \"Consider improving the coherence & cohesion aspect here.\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Use more varied linking words to connect your ideas.\", \"Improve paragraph structure with clearer topic sentences.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Lexical Resource\", \"band\": 6.5, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"Many said that educating inmates in prison is the most effective method to reduce the crime levels\", \"This is particularly important, especially when offenders re-assimilate into society and therefore prevent recidivism effectively\", \"In conclusion, it seems to me that although educating inmates in prison is an optimal way to reduce the crime level, it is not the best solution, as there are more feasible methods that could help such as imposing severe punishments and equipping students with crime knowledge\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"Many said that educating inmates in prison is the most effective method to reduce the crime levels\", \"type\": \"lexical\", \"fix\": \"Consider improving the lexical resource aspect here.\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Use more sophisticated vocabulary and avoid repetition.\", \"Focus on precise word choice and natural collocations.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Grammatical Range & Accuracy\", \"band\": 7.5, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"Many said that educating inmates in prison is the most effective method to reduce the crime levels\", \"This is particularly important, especially when offenders re-assimilate into society and therefore prevent recidivism effectively\", \"In conclusion, it seems to me that although educating inmates in prison is an optimal way to reduce the crime level, it is not the best solution, as there are more feasible methods that could help such as imposing severe punishments and equipping students with crime knowledge\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"Many said that educating inmates in prison is the most effective method to reduce the crime levels\", \"type\": \"grammar\", \"fix\": \"Consider improving the grammatical range & accuracy aspect here.\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Use more complex sentence structures.\", \"Check for grammatical errors and improve accuracy.\"]}], \"overall\": 7.0, \"votes\": [7.0, 7.0, 7.0], \"dispersion\": 0.0, \"confidence\": \"high\", \"meta\": {\"prompt_hash\": \"training_data\", \"model\": \"training\", \"schema_version\": \"v1\", \"rubric_version\": \"rubric/v1\", \"token_usage\": {\"input_tokens\": 392, \"output_tokens\": 500}}}"}]}

Owing to this,a heated debate has sparked on whether content watched or time spent on television influences their children behaviour. Both views are discussed in ensuring paragraphs along with my opinion. \n\nTo begin with, devoting more hours on television influences the social behaviour of children.More time spent in watching programmes broadcasted  ,makes them addictive overtime and and this addiction cuts them from their social circle ,eventually turning  into introvert individuals. Survey conducted by Child health development unit of Cambridge University reported that, television is considered to be the major factor behind the development of an introvert personality among individuals at their early age. Introvert adolescents are characterized by lack of confidence teacher and usually develops depression. Thus, time spent sitting behind screen influence the child's general nature at macro level.\n\nHowever the content shown have rather more detrimental effects on adolescents ; influencing there mental health. Content displayed generally constitutes violence, adultery and use of abusive language. Psychologists says that, children usually become what they see visually. Visual inputs are believed to have long lasting impact on Human Psychology. Statistics prove that children watching violence on television become more violent by nature on the other hand , those who watch comedy programs develops humorous behaviour . Hence, what is seen constantly, have impacts on child's mentality and impacts natural way of expression  .\n\nTo conclude, in my opinion the time duration does influence the behaviour of adolescents but it is actually the content  seen that decides and control children  behavioural characteristics at long run and good behaviour can be promoted  by effective parenting.\n\nProvide your assessment in the specified JSON format."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"per_criterion\": [{\"name\": \"Task Response\", \"band\": 5.5, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"Childhood is most tender age, which is considered to be greatly influenced by external factors\", \"Thus, time spent sitting behind screen influence the child's general nature at macro level\", \"To conclude, in my opinion the time duration does influence the behaviour of adolescents but it is actually the content  seen that decides and control children  behavioural characteristics at long run and good behaviour can be promoted  by effective parenting\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"Childhood is most tender age, which is considered to be greatly influenced by external factors\", \"type\": \"task\", \"fix\": \"Consider improving the task response aspect here.\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Develop your main arguments more fully with specific examples.\", \"Ensure you address all parts of the question directly.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Coherence & Cohesion\", \"band\": 4.5, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"Childhood is most tender age, which is considered to be greatly influenced by external factors\", \"Thus, time spent sitting behind screen influence the child's general nature at macro level\", \"To conclude, in my opinion the time duration does influence the behaviour of adolescents but it is actually the content  seen that decides and control children  behavioural characteristics at long run and good behaviour can be promoted  by effective parenting\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"Childhood is most tender age, which is considered to be greatly influenced by external factors\", \"type\": \"coherence\", \"fix\": \"Consider improving the coherence & cohesion aspect here.\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Use more varied linking words to connect your ideas.\", \"Improve paragraph structure with clearer topic sentences.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Lexical Resource\", \"band\": 4.5, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"Childhood is most tender age, which is considered to be greatly influenced by external factors\", \"Thus, time spent sitting behind screen influence the child's general nature at macro level\", \"To conclude, in my opinion the time duration does influence the behaviour of adolescents but it is actually the content  seen that decides and control children  behavioural characteristics at long run and good behaviour can be promoted  by effective parenting\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"Childhood is most tender age, which is considered to be greatly influenced by external factors\", \"type\": \"lexical\", \"fix\": \"Consider improving the lexical resource aspect here.\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Use more sophisticated vocabulary and avoid repetition.\", \"Focus on precise word choice and natural collocations.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Grammatical Range & Accuracy\", \"band\": 5.5, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"Childhood is most tender age, which is considered to be greatly influenced by external factors\", \"Thus, time spent sitting behind screen influence the child's general nature at macro level\", \"To conclude, in my opinion the time duration does influence the behaviour of adolescents but it is actually the content  seen that decides and control children  behavioural characteristics at long run and good behaviour can be promoted  by effective parenting\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"Childhood is most tender age, which is considered to be greatly influenced by external factors\", \"type\": \"grammar\", \"fix\": \"Consider improving the grammatical range & accuracy aspect here.\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Use more complex sentence structures.\", \"Check for grammatical errors and improve accuracy.\"]}], \"overall\": 5.0, \"votes\": [5.0, 5.0, 5.0], \"dispersion\": 0.0, \"confidence\": \"high\", \"meta\": {\"prompt_hash\": \"training_data\", \"model\": \"training\", \"schema_version\": \"v1\", \"rubric_version\": \"rubric/v1\", \"token_usage\": {\"input_tokens\": 308, \"output_tokens\": 500}}}"}]}

One of them is the increased number of transportation on the road and resulting traffic congestion which in turn causes delays and extra time on roads and also stress to everyone. This essay will discuss the causes of the high volume of traffic and solutions to prevent this problem. \r\n\r\nFirstly, it is true that each one of us dreams to have a car at some point in life. Therefore with affordability and paychecks, most of us, buy cars and in fact usually keep one car for each earning member of the family. Car-pooling arrangement does not even exist in a family, leave the neighbourhood. While, not alone personal desire, another reason to blame for the number of vehicles on the road is the poor public transport system. Connectivity issues and distant working places do not give a good choice of travel by the public transportation structure. Hence, people prefer to take their own car. \r\n\r\nFor example, in cities like Melbourne, New Delhi and Shanghai, often there are crowded roads ,especially during morning hours due to a lack of adequate government transportation and distant places. \r\n\r\nNext, how to improve and solve this issue of high number of vehicles. This can be resolved with a change in individuals' attitudes as well as with government support. Most important is to have more community buses and government should give a system with improved connectivity to places and promote and provide a clean and safe public transport system. \r\n\r\nIn conclusion, the rising figure of transit vehicles on the road is a common issue in major cities of the world.

Others think it has negative social effects because it will make people feel dissatisfied with who they are and what they have. Discuss both views and give your opinion.\n\nScore this IELTS Task 2 essay according to the rubric, ensuring alignment with the question:\n\nSome say that publicity causes positive economic effects, while others would argue that announcements are bad for society since they will make people feel unsatisfied with what they are and what they have. This essay will argue that although advertising captures consumers’ minds, a company’s economy will increase.\r\n\r\nOn the one hand, all publicity will exaggerate how is the product and try to tell the consumers that their product is the best, and they should have it. This is a way of getting more clients, but sometimes the advertising uses incorrect words and expression to persuade people to buy their products, which harms individuals' heart, and make them doubt  themselves  if they are really  what the announcement says. For instance, there are many announcements that  say that the ones who are watching the advertising are nothing,  they need to consume the company’s product to make the individual happier and have a higher social status. However, I believe that this is easy to solve  since most people know what the companies are trying to do, and they are very self-confident, so are not affected by what others say.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, companies will invest in advertisements so they can reach more people. This is because almost everyone will use their mobile phone to watch social media, and if companies insert publicity in these pages, more people are able to know the company and the products they sell. Even though maybe at the time they do not need to buy products,  people will remember the announcement and can search for it in the future. Also, now all social media have a technology that knows what the user likes and what you need, so they will recommend related products. This will cause an increase in the company’s economy. For instance, people using Instagram can watch several advertisements when watching the histories and photos uploaded by their friends, also the application has a dedicated tab for sales. I believe that advertising products allow more individuals to know about products that some brands sell.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, although some announcements use the wrong way to persuade people to buy their product, the Internet and technology that there are now  will directly recommend the individuals what they want, increasing the number of sales, and this is why I think that advertising will

Many folks believe that only the government  is able to solve this problem. However, from the way I am thinking, I do not agree with this idea.\n\nOn the one hand, it is undeniable that one of many government responsibilities is to ensure that the residents have houses to live in. I am convinced that all the councils in the world, regardless of the region where the cities are based. I remember a friend of mine once said that in his home country, the executive prepared and constructed buildings to accommodate the citizens. I was blown away when I heard this and imagined if the government in my homeland do the same thing. However, I realize that there are other, arguably more emerging, issues that are faced by the government, that need to be solved first. So waiting for the government to singlehandedly solve the housing issue is not a wise move we can do as a resident, especially if we are not from the richest country on this planet.\n\nOn top of the government, I strongly believe that other players also play the same key role in this issue, the private sector for instance. They can contribute to tackling the issue in their own ways. Whereas banks can help its customer  get a friendly loan to buy a house, property companies could provide an easy scheme to pay for the houses. Those are only two of many examples of how private sectors are able to help. What I want to say is that only government  can solve this issue. \n\nTo sum up, I do not agree with people who think that only the executive can break down the problem as I strongly believe either government or non-government can help on their own, as aforementioned explanations.\n\nProvide your assessment in the specified JSON format."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"per_criterion\": [{\"name\": \"Task Response\", \"band\": 6.0, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"Housing shortages in big cities are a common issue we are facing nowadays\", \"However, I realize that there are other, arguably more emerging, issues that are faced by the government, that need to be solved first\", \"To sum up, I do not agree with people who think that only the executive can break down the problem as I strongly believe either government or non-government can help on their own, as aforementioned explanations\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"Housing shortages in big cities are a common issue we are facing nowadays\", \"type\": \"task\", \"fix\": \"Consider improving the task response aspect here.\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Develop your main arguments more fully with specific examples.\", \"Ensure you address all parts of the question directly.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Coherence & Cohesion\", \"band\": 5.0, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"Housing shortages in big cities are a common issue we are facing nowadays\", \"However, I realize that there are other, arguably more emerging, issues that are faced by the government, that need to be solved first\", \"To sum up, I do not agree with people who think that only the executive can break down the problem as I strongly believe either government or non-government can help on their own, as aforementioned explanations\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"Housing shortages in big cities are a common issue we are facing nowadays\", \"type\": \"coherence\", \"fix\": \"Consider improving the coherence & cohesion aspect here.\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Use more varied linking words to connect your ideas.\", \"Improve paragraph structure with clearer topic sentences.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Lexical Resource\", \"band\": 5.0, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"Housing shortages in big cities are a common issue we are facing nowadays\", \"However, I realize that there are other, arguably more emerging, issues that are faced by the government, that need to be solved first\", \"To sum up, I do not agree with people who think that only the executive can break down the problem as I strongly believe either government or non-government can help on their own, as aforementioned explanations\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"Housing shortages in big cities are a common issue we are facing nowadays\", \"type\": \"lexical\", \"fix\": \"Consider improving the lexical resource aspect here.\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Use more sophisticated vocabulary and avoid repetition.\", \"Focus on precise word choice and natural collocations.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Grammatical Range & Accuracy\", \"band\": 6.0, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"Housing shortages in big cities are a common issue we are facing nowadays\", \"However, I realize that there are other, arguably more emerging, issues that are faced by the government, that need to be solved first\", \"To sum up, I do not agree with people who think that only the executive can break down the problem as I strongly believe either government or non-government can help on their own, as aforementioned explanations\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"Housing shortages in big cities are a common issue we are facing nowadays\", \"type\": \"grammar\", \"fix\": \"Consider improving the grammatical range & accuracy aspect here.\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Use more complex sentence structures.\", \"Check for grammatical errors and improve accuracy.\"]}], \"overall\": 5.5, \"votes\": [5.5, 5.5, 5.5], \"dispersion\": 0.0, \"confidence\": \"high\", \"meta\": {\"prompt_hash\": \"training_data\", \"model\": \"training\", \"schema_version\": \"v1\", \"rubric_version\": \"rubric/v1\", \"token_usage\": {\"input_tokens\": 327, \"output_tokens\": 500}}}"}]}

Discuss both views and give your opinion.\n\nScore this IELTS Task 2 essay according to the rubric, ensuring alignment with the question:\n\nMany people generally believe that individuals should seek for a job immediately after graduation. While there are some merits to support that idea, I would argue that pursuing further education is the best way to become successful.\n\nOn the one hand, the option to get a job has some certain benefits. To begin with, people are more likely to be financially independent since they could earn the money soon and help their family cover some expenses to reduce the family's financial burden. On top of that, they also have chances to gain more real-world experience sooner than other their peers and they would bring it into practice with the aim of getting a competitive salary in the future. Moreover, with dense experiences and a great deal of practical skills, they have a tendency to get married soon and take care of their family very well.\n\n\tOn the other hand, there are numerous reasons why I believe continuing to study tertiary education would be the most right choice. The first rationale is that there are some work positions that require relevant qualifications. These could range from dentists and doctors to lecturers that people lending a job straight away could not couldn't do it.

How can people research this?\n\nScore this IELTS Task 2 essay according to the rubric, ensuring alignment with the question:\n\nIt is true that a building with the dominant purpose of being a shelter hides its aesthetic and cultural values. Nevertheless, there is a progressively increasing number of residents who get more involved in studying the history of the place where they live in. Safety and interest are considered the main reasons for this trend.\r\n\r\nImproved living standard has led humans to be more conscious about their lives in general, safety in particular. Like food intake and healthcare, they care about their accommodation. To be more specific, they are curious if their buildings are well constructed or not or when they were built. It is no exaggeration to say that a rundown apartment being built 50 years ago is not a preferable choice. By researching the house or the flat they are living, people likely are able to reduce the risks of unsafety. Another reason is perhaps their hobby. Living in fast-paced life with a myriad of stress, taking up a hobby is not a bad way. In this case, what these people are doing is somehow like an explorer discovering the past and this brings them contentment and joyness.\r\n\r\nTo know about the past of a building or an apartment, asking nearby neighbours, not least the elderly may be the most feasible method. These local residents are witnesses themselves who then become storytellers. Another plausible way is that they could facilitate the local library where regional-related articles are kept. To some extent, they might be lucky to find some piles of paper mentioning the construction site such as the conductor's name and construction time. These are obviously invaluable clues for them to find out more about the building's past. \r\n\r\nIn conclusion, it seems to me that more people become more enthusiastic to study about their house's history because of their own safety and interests.

The art has different form that i mentioned ago, so it is depend on mindset  of a particular childchild. These day governments should give interest in the essential subject of art in schools. art can help to children express their ideas, thoughts and also increase their creativity too.  There are main two subject of art are in the schools nowadays. it is music and drawing , these subjects are common in schools. There is one idiom is that \" a child who can learn or understand things better than teenagers\" mean it is an age of to learn quickly. if you get younger than you have been taking more time for learning art. In childhood there is a no  tation about any things so they can easily understand and grasp anything like an art.

It seems logical that the priority of any company should be to cover its running costs, such as employees wages and payments for buildings and utilities. On the top of these costs, companies also need to invest in improvements and innovations if they wish to remain successful. If a company is unable to pay its bills or meet the changing needs of the customers, any concerns about social responsibilities become irrelevant. In other words, a company can only make a positive contribution to the society if it is in a good financial health.\nOn the other hand, companies should not be run with the sole aim of maximizing profits. They have a vital role to play in society. One social obligation that owners and managers have is to treat their employees wel,  rather than exploiting them. For example, they could pay a living wage to ensure that the workers have a good quality of life. I also like the idea that businesses could use a proportion of their profits to support local charities , environmental projects and educative  initiatives. Finally, instead of trying to minimise their tax payments by using accounting loopholes, I believe that company bosses should be happy to contribute to society through the text system.\nIn conclusion, I believe that company should place as much importance on their social responsibilities as they do on their financial objectives.\n\nProvide your assessment in the specified JSON format."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"per_criterion\": [{\"name\": \"Task Response\", \"band\": 6.5, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"Businesses have always sought to make profits but it is becoming increasingly common to hear people talk about the social obligations that companies have\", \"On the other hand, companies should not be run with the sole aim of maximizing profits\", \"In conclusion, I believe that company should place as much importance on their social responsibilities as they do on their financial objectives\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"Businesses have always sought to make profits but it is becoming increasingly common to hear people \", \"type\": \"task\", \"fix\": \"Consider improving the task response aspect here.\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Develop your main arguments more fully with specific examples.\", \"Ensure you address all parts of the question directly.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Coherence & Cohesion\", \"band\": 5.5, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"Businesses have always sought to make profits but it is becoming increasingly common to hear people talk about the social obligations that companies have\", \"On the other hand, companies should not be run with the sole aim of maximizing profits\", \"In conclusion, I believe that company should place as much importance on their social responsibilities as they do on their financial objectives\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"Businesses have always sought to make profits but it is becoming increasingly common to hear people \", \"type\": \"coherence\", \"fix\": \"Consider improving the coherence & cohesion aspect here.\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Use more varied linking words to connect your ideas.\", \"Improve paragraph structure with clearer topic sentences.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Lexical Resource\", \"band\": 5.5, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"Businesses have always sought to make profits but it is becoming increasingly common to hear people talk about the social obligations that companies have\", \"On the other hand, companies should not be run with the sole aim of maximizing profits\", \"In conclusion, I believe that company should place as much importance on their social responsibilities as they do on their financial objectives\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"Businesses have always sought to make profits but it is becoming increasingly common to hear people \", \"type\": \"lexical\", \"fix\": \"Consider improving the lexical resource aspect here.\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Use more sophisticated vocabulary and avoid repetition.\", \"Focus on precise word choice and natural collocations.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Grammatical Range & Accuracy\", \"band\": 6.5, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"Businesses have always sought to make profits but it is becoming increasingly common to hear people talk about the social obligations that companies have\", \"On the other hand, companies should not be run with the sole aim of maximizing profits\", \"In conclusion, I believe that company should place as much importance on their social responsibilities as they do on their financial objectives\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"Businesses have always sought to make profits but it is becoming increasingly common to hear people \", \"type\": \"grammar\", \"fix\": \"Consider improving the grammatical range & accuracy aspect here.\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Use more complex sentence structures.\", \"Check for grammatical errors and improve accuracy.\"]}], \"overall\": 6.0, \"votes\": [6.0, 6.0, 6.0], \"dispersion\": 0.0, \"confidence\": \"high\", \"meta\": {\"prompt_hash\": \"training_data\", \"model\": \"training\", \"schema_version\": \"v1\", \"rubric_version\": \"rubric/v1\", \"token_usage\": {\"input_tokens\": 308, \"output_tokens\": 500}}}"}]}

Some people convince that they are part of the relaxation, while others reject this notion.

In   this  case,   the national  government is the only one to tackle   this  issue. I am fully agreed that   the governer  has the main responsibility to have sufficient housing in commercial   cities  to prevent unnecessary side   effect  . The main reason that causes the shortage of housing in   downtown  is increasing the population day by day who migrate from countryside  to work as the daily workers   ,especially  in construction sectors and many industries.   society  are moving to   center  which offer   greater employment and   a higher  standard of living.   For instance  , most of the   city's  life can access   the internet  , mobile banking,   and convenient  transportation system.   As a result  , accommodation places are more and more demanding   significantly  for   blue-collar  workers who can only afford   a low  budget   houses  .   Additionally  ,   several  side   effects  has been occurred   such  as   water  shortage and electricity   getting  by hourly.   Moreover  , accommodation and domestic   water  supply cannot be separated in urban life. If the population and urban   water  system ratio   are  not equal, there will be many  consequences  related to   people's  health   problems  ,   for example  ,   people  cannot use sufficient   water  amount for their   water  and sanitation purposes. Another particular   problem  of big city life is   having  good   practices  and management system of household waste. If the governments cannot control daily waste, the diseases   of diaherra  and flu can be spread easily. In   this  case,   people  have to spend extra charges for their health.

This essay will discuss plenty of reasons related to this phenomenon and suggest methods accordingly in order to obtain a wide range of information needed.\r\n\r\nThe rise of interest in exploring backgrounds in which people live is associated with two possible explanations. Firstly, architecture is the foundation factor as most ancient buildings are full-packed with unique design styles and ideas, which forces people, particularly those who are fascinated with design and construction concerns, to gain an in-depth understanding of the materials their building is made of. As a result, they might take the knowledge as a reference for future modifications or refurbishment. Additionally, mystery effortlessly catches one’s attention and emotionally drives them curious about the past occasions which occurred during the different generations. In other words, people could immediately witness first-hand history or experience golden memories, which they went through, one more time again.\r\n\r\nA variety of approaches could be taken into consideration to support the process given above. To begin with, older generations or former dwellers are considered as the most reliable source as they could give insights on incidents and reveal secrets about these houses or even the living areas.  Furthermore, the rapid development of the internet provides people with a wide range of information and documents which can be easily searched online with one click. From that, people are capable of understanding all the concerns regarding architecture-related problems, such as the construction stage and idea, materials and patterns.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, there are various methods that could be considered in order to give people assistance on the way to learn more about the background of their accommodation.\n\nProvide your assessment in the specified JSON format."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"per_criterion\": [{\"name\": \"Task Response\", \"band\": 8.0, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"Exploring the history of places of which citizens own has gained in popularity in several regions\", \"In other words, people could immediately witness first-hand history or experience golden memories, which they went through, one more time again\", \"In conclusion, there are various methods that could be considered in order to give people assistance on the way to learn more about the background of their accommodation\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"Exploring the history of places of which citizens own has gained in popularity in several regions\", \"type\": \"task\", \"fix\": \"Consider improving the task response aspect here.\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Develop your main arguments more fully with specific examples.\", \"Ensure you address all parts of the question directly.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Coherence & Cohesion\", \"band\": 7.0, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"Exploring the history of places of which citizens own has gained in popularity in several regions\", \"In other words, people could immediately witness first-hand history or experience golden memories, which they went through, one more time again\", \"In conclusion, there are various methods that could be considered in order to give people assistance on the way to learn more about the background of their accommodation\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"Exploring the history of places of which citizens own has gained in popularity in several regions\", \"type\": \"coherence\", \"fix\": \"Consider improving the coherence & cohesion aspect here.\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Use more varied linking words to connect your ideas.\", \"Improve paragraph structure with clearer topic sentences.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Lexical Resource\", \"band\": 7.0, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"Exploring the history of places of which citizens own has gained in popularity in several regions\", \"In other words, people could immediately witness first-hand history or experience golden memories, which they went through, one more time again\", \"In conclusion, there are various methods that could be considered in order to give people assistance on the way to learn more about the background of their accommodation\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"Exploring the history of places of which citizens own has gained in popularity in several regions\", \"type\": \"lexical\", \"fix\": \"Consider improving the lexical resource aspect here.\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Use more sophisticated vocabulary and avoid repetition.\", \"Focus on precise word choice and natural collocations.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Grammatical Range & Accuracy\", \"band\": 8.0, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"Exploring the history of places of which citizens own has gained in popularity in several regions\", \"In other words, people could immediately witness first-hand history or experience golden memories, which they went through, one more time again\", \"In conclusion, there are various methods that could be considered in order to give people assistance on the way to learn more about the background of their accommodation\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"Exploring the history of places of which citizens own has gained in popularity in several regions\", \"type\": \"grammar\", \"fix\": \"Consider improving the grammatical range & accuracy aspect here.\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Use more complex sentence structures.\", \"Check for grammatical errors and improve accuracy.\"]}], \"overall\": 7.5, \"votes\": [7.5, 7.5, 7.5], \"dispersion\": 0.0, \"confidence\": \"high\", \"meta\": {\"prompt_hash\": \"training_data\", \"model\": \"training\", \"schema_version\": \"v1\", \"rubric_version\": \"rubric/v1\", \"token_usage\": {\"input_tokens\": 320, \"output_tokens\": 500}}}"}]}

This essay will explain the reason for this phenomenon as well as describe how the way  people find it out.\r\n\r\nFirst of all, people are looking for the background of the place where they stay due to the recent issues about the land conflicts. This is simply because some citizens are not clever enough to deal with the right land seller which is sometimes a swindler; as a result,  later problems such as building destruction might happen. That is why people start to search for their house’s real history. In addition, humans tend to be scared about the myths storey of any place ,especially their own house; therefore they choose to explore the fact behind their place and its surroundings to fulfil their curiosity. \r\n\r\nIn terms of researching  history, one of the most common ways to do this is by asking the former residents about the true past story about the building. They can help to share brief information whether the house is safe or not. Furthermore, we can check out the legality of the documents of the building or the land we stay on in order to make sure there will be no  controversy regarding the land in the future.

What factors may have caused this situation and what, in your opinion,   should be done about it?\n\nScore this IELTS Task 2 essay according to the rubric, ensuring alignment with the question:\n\nWhen young people are choosing what subject to study at university, most of them hope they   will find a great job upon graduation. In reality many fresh graduates fail to find work in their field   and some are even forced to take up a below graduate level job. In my opinion, the root of this   problem lies in the outdated higher education system that should be modernized.   Traditional university education does not prepare students for their first job for a number of   reasons. One of them is that many programmes are too theoretical. It means that highly   educated graduates lack simple skills required for employment, for example, the knowledge of   IT software. Employers, therefore, prefer candidates with hands-on experience. Another reason is   that universities offer too many courses in popular fields, such as business and law, and do not   recruit enough students for engineering and science programmes. As a result, the UK labour   market has an oversupply of law graduates and a deficit of engineers.   A reform of higher education could alleviate many of the problems but would require joint   efforts from universities and the government. If universities worked closer with employers, they   could teach students practical skills that companies look for. Meanwhile, the government could   develop guidelines on how many students universities should recruit in each subject in   accordance with the market demand.

To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?\n\nScore this IELTS Task 2 essay according to the rubric, ensuring alignment with the question:\n\nAccording to various ,reports there is a high proportion of poorly educated criminals among the total share. Therefore some people suggest providing literacy for released from prisons people in order to help them to adapt and have a decent work placement. I can agree with the idea because there are some practical benefits both for the individual and the society.\r\n\r\nTo begin with, commonly known that most criminals tend to repeat their mistakes or having some particular habits from prison. This makes them very vulnerable as not many employers can invite them to work, ,Moreover a concrete degree and a high in demand speciality can increase the chance of entering the labour market, because when there is a lack of human resources more people are welcomed. For example, intense demand for truck drivers caused by Brexit, gives a  motivation for ex-prisoners to be trained and then employed.  In addition, following training expenses can be comparatively less than spendings on prisoners keeping and the damage they can possibly make if the crimes will be repeated. Is not it easier to prevent a criminal rather than to punish him later? \r\n\r\nOn the other hand, this issue has been existing for a long time, and countries with a more educated society have the lowest crime rate in the world. Children who spend most of their time  studying and hobbies are more likely to persuade higher education and achieve career goals. Parents of those invest significant time and money to create and support the interest of studying of their youngers.\r\n\r\nTo conclude it is logical that the education system needs to be improved, because it will decrease the possibility of a crime committing.

To what extent do you agree or disagree?\n\nScore this IELTS Task 2 essay according to the rubric, ensuring alignment with the question:\n\nIn the modern society, people’s work clothes have attracted much concern.Some people hold the view that the style of the staff should not be paid attention to by the manager on the grounds that the work productivity is of importance. Personally, I believe the way they dress completely depends on the type of their company or job.\r\nOn the one hand, formal clothes are suitable for profesional jobs as well as in disciplined settings. Several certain jobs such as lawyer, doctor, teacher and even sales people require people dress up smartly and courteously which undoutedly boost confidence and work efficiency.For example, when wearing white blouse in the hospital, doctors may be more aware of the value of their work in order to try their best to fulfill their duty. Futhermore, should they wear smart clothes, they will be respectful towards others, which affects social interaction and be enormously significant to those face-to-face jobs, especially marketing or receptionist.\r\nOn the other hand, there are remarkable reasons why a multitude of individuals  hold the notion that using formal clothes is unnecessary. First of all, clothings are not reflective of the worker’s own performance or their ability. For instance, technological company like Google and Facebook are well-known for their relaxed dress codes because they aim to create an informal, exciting and creative environment; consequently, they produce sophisticated and convenient products despite casual clothes.

However, some cliam that fashion influences people lives in an adversely, others say that this has more positive effects on our day-to-day lives. This essay discuss the both viewpoints and give my opinion in the subsequent paragraphs. \r\n\r\nOn the one hand, fashion industry plays a crucial role in country's economy through import and export cloths and materials. There are massive amount of the public can get earnings from this sector such as wavers, tailors, shopers and etc. Fashion changes in every occassion, every year by the fashion designers, they are the main reason for the innovation in this sector and people also can wear new trendy dress. For example, many boutiques have started by the fashion designer and they attract the population by their new designs with what kind of material they use. Therefore, mankind are able to obtain enormous benefits in their lives. \r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the negativities of this trend cannot be ignored because it affects folk's day-to-day life differnetly which means humankind spend more money to buy new trendy dresses even they have plenty in their wardrobes. It  stimulates more buying capacities, as a result, mankind might be dressaholic. For instance, a recent survey from the Times of India said that, Indian people have spent 40% of their earnings on buying cloths which means they are being dressaholic and addicted, besides, they should save their salary for their future because anything will happen in future like if happens any medical emergency, saving money only will be helped rather than dress and fashion. \r\n\r\nTo conclude, Fashion field is an inevitable in people lives. Although it gives a plenty of advantages to the population such as livlihood and wear new trendy dress like celebrities, the public spends huge amount to buy many dresses and they become addict.

There are some who claim that it is important to support  the artists, and others who are opposed to government funding. In the following  paragraphs, I shall discuss both sides of the argument and finally give my opinion.  There are many reasons why government should fund artists. The contributions of  artists to the society are very essential. Art can bring out people’s creativity, views and  personalities. For example, we learn about our history, traditions and culture through  movies, songs and paintings made by artists. Artists are the media of diffusing  tradition. All kinds of tradition are the basis of a country without which the country  can’t be civilised. So artists are the ambassadors of culture and play a vital role in  elevating the level of civilization of the country. It is a major form of cultural  abundance.  Another important aspect of this is that art is an ancient means of communication.  Our language is a result of people’s need to communicate. Art is what differentiates us  from animals. Art is our soul and it is a source of courage. Artists also entertain us.  Finally, government should fund artists because earning a livelihood from art is  difficult especially in the budding stages.  Opponents of government funding on artists say that money spent on the arts could  have been used for considerably more vital purposes. They have strong reasons as a  nation’s health and wellbeing should be paramount. The idea that elderly people are  forced to wait for essential operations whilst the money required to increase available  medical provision is spent on opera and ballet is plainly immoral. There are also more  deserving social causes for the money that should be considered before the arts.  Homelessness, unemployment, illiteracy – all of these deserve to be addressed before  money is spent on what is essentially little more than entertainment.  To summarise, I would like to say that as both sides have strong arguments, it depends  on the condition of the country.

Although by activity of dozens of scientists and environmentalists most factories have been encouraged to implement green approaches, most of these methods are relying on recycling rather than plunging down or reusing, seemingly have not adequate to tackle with environmental problems.

Certainly, the child's behaviour changes can be associated with the television content that is believed by many individuals. However, others argue that spending a length of time while watching tv programs is a major factor in their growth. This essay will discuss why the content of the program is taking considerable concern for all in the below paragraph.\nThere are numbers of valid arguments against television channel which is represented that what offsprings watch on television influence their nurture. To commence with, child age may be considered as a vulnerable age, because this is a stage of life where individuals are motivated from their surrounding actions, and they, perhaps, liking to do with actual, without knowing its consequences. Thus, if children watch the television shows, where evil is represented as a superior, it would be motivated to pursue the same task in their vicinity. By contrast, if adolescents are addicted to seeing regional programs or other informative television shows, it would help them to learn good manners and surge their general knowledge respectively. For instance, research was carried out in schools revealed that 75% of children who have good manners, respect for teachers, sincere in class, and intelligence, they have controlled of their parents in selecting program contents, including cartoons and other entertainment programs.\nOn the other hand, there are a various reasons why the length of time spent watching television programs that has negative effects on the development of children both about physically and psychologically. Firstly, children are exposed to excess radiant flashes of light, this could cause serious damage to eyes, and sometimes temporary blindness if they watch excessively. Secondly, utilising, numbers of hours in front of the television which can increase the health risk at a  child age. Obesity, headache and visual impairment at a young age are the main health problems of using a TV for a long period of time. Finally, if a young one spends time to do another activity such as reading, physical exercise and other sports rather than watching television which would help them for a healthy lifestyle.\nTo sum up, although spending enormous time on television program has various health issues, there would be outweighed by program content in the long term.

Consequently, it needs time and wisdom to cope with the situation. \r\n\r\n However, another thing that should be taken into consideration is physical state of women. A major difficult is that naturally there could be an enormous health risk. This is the main and the most dangerous threaten that can occur. For instance, woman might not be pregnant after the heavy birthing of child. According to the scientist`s researchs, there exist a common opinion that after thirty years female`s inside is reconstructed that poorly endures pressure. \r\n\r\n In conclusion, there is no appropriate time for youths birth, the core thing is it should be secure as for mother and baby.

To what extent do you agree or disagree with this statement?\n\nScore this IELTS Task 2 essay according to the rubric, ensuring alignment with the question:\n\nResearchers have shown a positive correlation between a prisoner's level of education and their tendency of committing a crime. While several people think that if the government makes some arrangements to educate the prisoner, perhaps crime will be deterred, I believe that educating the people only in prison could not solve this phenomenon.\r\n\r\nIt is distinct that education discourages people from becoming involved in illegal works. For example, in America, research shows that many people who do not have minimum education level or any training to get a good job commit crimes the most. This is because when a person does not get any job, he might be getting involved in foul deeds for their livelihood. Hence, the government should take responsibility to educate the underprivileged persons before they do any terrible job.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, The jail authority might introduce some job training for the prisoner; thus, they can acquire knowledge about a particular work, and after imprisonment, they could get a better job opportunity to earn their bread and butter. Moreover, prisoners should go through counselling arranged by mental health professionals, which will help them understand how harmful their works are for the nation. For instance, In Norway, the government has set up a monthly counselling programme. As a result, within some months, there has been a change seen among the criminals.\r\n\r\nTo conclude, it seems that education is the most significant way to reduce crimes in society, but in my perspective, it will not be fruitful to educate only the prisoners.

It’s very important to save the cultural heritage of the place we live in or if it’s old buildings or houses we can recreate them without changing any of the original touches.

Unfortunately, this will encourage them to come back and get others with them. Moreover, this will increase the outcome, and thus the government can enhance the quality of tourism. However, different ways are used to search for information regarding a building’s history. Such details can be obtained from the town’s local library, where old archives are kept and surely reliable. Moreover, Online websites can be a way to learn more about the historic facts wanted. Furthermore, asking the elderly can give the data needed about the old days. For example, it is often the oldest community members who know the past more than the others as they may have been alive when some historic events happened.\r\n\r\nTo conclude, it is easy for people to search for their history by just keeping them.

I strongly believe that although international companies cannot be responsible for solving social problems, small businesses should be accompanied by local communities in curbing certain issues.\r\n\r\nThe first and foremost argument is that businesses have a great impact on society as well as contribute to a country's economic posterity. To extend, businesses have a significant role in preventing society from turning into a 'throw-away society' and producing waste resources. Consequently, companies should enlighten local people to be aware of certain issues such as consumerism, capitalism, etc. To cite an example, several businesses published advertisements to inform people about inflation on social media platforms in Turkey. As a result, people did not tend to buy products for the risk of the waste of money for a while. This emphasises the significance of the effects on society while having these companies.\r\n\r\nRegarding another argument, businesses also should take action when natural accidents happen. To expand the idea, while natural accidents such as earthquakes, downpours, etc, they are obliged to help with their equipment, or financially. For instance, the big earthquake, which was measured 7,4 points out of 12, happened in 2023 in Turkey. During this period, all small and international businesses volunteered to donate adequately to the minister of health, and they opened supplies such as cars, and agricultural machines for free to use.\r\n\r\nTo conclude, despite a belief that people deem businesses do not have any social responsibility in today's world, I am on the side of people who understand the gravity of actions taken by companies.\n\nProvide your assessment in the specified JSON format."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"per_criterion\": [{\"name\": \"Task Response\", \"band\": 7.0, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"There is an ongoing debate about whether businesses should undertake responsibilities or not, advocating the importance of being involved in social activities as a significant action\", \"As a result, people did not tend to buy products for the risk of the waste of money for a while\", \"To conclude, despite a belief that people deem businesses do not have any social responsibility in today's world, I am on the side of people who understand the gravity of actions taken by companies\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"There is an ongoing debate about whether businesses should undertake responsibilities or not, advoca\", \"type\": \"task\", \"fix\": \"Consider improving the task response aspect here.\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Develop your main arguments more fully with specific examples.\", \"Ensure you address all parts of the question directly.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Coherence & Cohesion\", \"band\": 6.0, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"There is an ongoing debate about whether businesses should undertake responsibilities or not, advocating the importance of being involved in social activities as a significant action\", \"As a result, people did not tend to buy products for the risk of the waste of money for a while\", \"To conclude, despite a belief that people deem businesses do not have any social responsibility in today's world, I am on the side of people who understand the gravity of actions taken by companies\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"There is an ongoing debate about whether businesses should undertake responsibilities or not, advoca\", \"type\": \"coherence\", \"fix\": \"Consider improving the coherence & cohesion aspect here.\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Use more varied linking words to connect your ideas.\", \"Improve paragraph structure with clearer topic sentences.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Lexical Resource\", \"band\": 6.0, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"There is an ongoing debate about whether businesses should undertake responsibilities or not, advocating the importance of being involved in social activities as a significant action\", \"As a result, people did not tend to buy products for the risk of the waste of money for a while\", \"To conclude, despite a belief that people deem businesses do not have any social responsibility in today's world, I am on the side of people who understand the gravity of actions taken by companies\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"There is an ongoing debate about whether businesses should undertake responsibilities or not, advoca\", \"type\": \"lexical\", \"fix\": \"Consider improving the lexical resource aspect here.\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Use more sophisticated vocabulary and avoid repetition.\", \"Focus on precise word choice and natural collocations.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Grammatical Range & Accuracy\", \"band\": 7.0, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"There is an ongoing debate about whether businesses should undertake responsibilities or not, advocating the importance of being involved in social activities as a significant action\", \"As a result, people did not tend to buy products for the risk of the waste of money for a while\", \"To conclude, despite a belief that people deem businesses do not have any social responsibility in today's world, I am on the side of people who understand the gravity of actions taken by companies\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"There is an ongoing debate about whether businesses should undertake responsibilities or not, advoca\", \"type\": \"grammar\", \"fix\": \"Consider improving the grammatical range & accuracy aspect here.\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Use more complex sentence structures.\", \"Check for grammatical errors and improve accuracy.\"]}], \"overall\": 6.5, \"votes\": [6.5, 6.5, 6.5], \"dispersion\": 0.0, \"confidence\": \"high\", \"meta\": {\"prompt_hash\": \"training_data\", \"model\": \"training\", \"schema_version\": \"v1\", \"rubric_version\": \"rubric/v1\", \"token_usage\": {\"input_tokens\": 300, \"output_tokens\": 500}}}"}]}

This essay highlights the primary causes for this trend and describes how they figure this out. \r\n\r\nOne of the main explanations is to be aware of any social problems such as robbery and crime that may have occurred around their accommodation in the past. It is surely a reliable reference for them to decide whether to continue to live there or to move to another place. Besides that, those who had no choice of changing location, probably have a plan to prevent such threatening issues. In addition, researching the history of the building, which means thoroughly understanding the building age, the original structure, and the purpose used by the previous owners, is to answer their concerns about its quality and sustainability. For instance, a house or a building that was constructed over 10 years ago with traditional design and has suffered from many different objectives of the other landlords, cannot ensure its long duration of use.\r\n\r\nThere are several ways to learn about its history. Firstly, it is quite easy to access and search the information such as the previous owners and what the building had been used for via the Internet. Moreover, by visiting and asking neighbors who have lived there for a long period, residents may collect tons of news, especially some rumors and thrilling stories that probably are not published to society. Someone even asks the retail agency and government officers directly for more details.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, in some countries, inhabitants these days are more excited to learn about the stories of the place they live in, for various reasons including their safety and their houses’ life expectancy.

Some people suggest that the solution to this problem is to increase the price of  fattening foods. To what extent do you agree or disagree?\n\nScore this IELTS Task 2 essay according to the rubric, ensuring alignment with the question:\n\nObesity has become a serious health concern in many countries. While many people believe that increase in the price of fatty foods can help to tackle this problem, I believe, that other ways such as subsidising healthy food options can also be employed. In my opinion, a combination of these two is the best way forward.\r\n\r\nIt is true that the rise in the cost of junk food can help to reduce the problem of overweight. For instance, the sugar tax imposed in UK did have some positive benefits. However, companies reacted to this by reducing the sugar content just below the taxed slab which made more and more people buy this slightiest healthier version, without actually serving the purpose. In addition, this practise may look more of a punishment for those who are financially limited and cannot move to higher priced goods. \r\n\r\nInstead of inflating prices, reducing the prices of healthy foods can be more attractive choice in handling the concern of obesity.

I agree with this viewpoint.\r\n\r\nCertain urgent problems can only be effectively addressed through collaboration with other countries. For instance, in the aftermath of a conflict, residents often find themselves grappling with injuries, homelessness, food and water shortages, and even threats to their lives. Moreover, in such dire situations, local governments may lack the resources and capabilities to provide swift and comprehensive solutions. Therefore, international support becomes paramount. Whether through organizations or the governments of other nations, it plays a crucial role in safeguarding human rights. Such help may involve rescuing the affected population, supplying essential resources, and offering overseas shelter to refugees.\r\n\r\nConversely, not all urgent problems necessitate external intervention, as seen in the case of crime rates. Persistent and multifaceted concerns, like crime, are intricately linked to various domestic factors such as education, employment, and the efficacy of legal policies. Consequently, the responsibility lies squarely with domestic authorities to institute long-term solutions rather than relying solely on international aid. Nevertheless, seeking advice from other nations can serve as a valuable reference for improving local strategies.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, while international collaboration is undeniably a potent method for addressing urgent challenges, the capacity of local governments should not be underestimated. The dynamics of each issue determine whether it requires a global or domestic approach.

Many newspaper columnists add some spice to their articles to make it a selling point to the reader as the subtleness will not interest the readers. Because of this, people involved in falsified articles have their image tarnished, consequently affecting their lives and their close ones with bad publicity.\r\n\r\nTo conclude, people should not completely believe and perceive the news article and react to it.

On the other hand, because not all the old houses have to be bad, victorian houses that they can be very old have an amazing quality and apart from that the design is something that still in our times designers try to copy, but in my opinion nothing better than the original one.

Otherwise some people find it fascinating that the house was built in some historical moment so they can feel that they are part of it. \r\n\r\nUsually the best way to collect this information is going to the council and look when the house was made and after that you have a point to start searching for information from the area.

And one of them is using social media to inform people as for all benefits living in village. Additionally,they came up with idea to provides convenient way to get job from village. In results,near 15 percentage of local population moved countries.\n\nReturning again to job question, governments of the country should provide more vacancy suggestions in the rural areas, as more than 90 percentage of people moved to metropolis just for getting a well-paid job. It would be nice to mention latest poll conducted by authorities of the Maharashtra province demonstrated that near 35 percentage of youths don’t wanna live in a large city,but forced to do that, due to luck of job suggestions. \n\nSo, If job opportunities increased,people would be more willing to move countryside.\n\nHowever ,it should be mentioned, that citizens and builders also play an important role in solving this problem. They could help authorities by doing at least something like invest more in building skyscrapers and flats. Apartment usually require less space on the land, whereas, bungalows require it more. \n\nTo summarise, there are some  possible ways to deal with lack of housing is encouraging people to move countryside and provides more job opportunities there. Therefore, shortage of housing can’t be completed solved by citizens ,but for government. After thorough analysis on this subject, it is predicted that after moving some people in villages, housing shortage will be adjusted\n\nProvide your assessment in the specified JSON format."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"per_criterion\": [{\"name\": \"Task Response\", \"band\": 4.5, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"In the contemporary days a lot of cities experiencing dramatic growth\", \"Additionally,they came up with idea to provides convenient way to get job from village\", \"After thorough analysis on this subject, it is predicted that after moving some people in villages, housing shortage will be adjusted\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"In the contemporary days a lot of cities experiencing dramatic growth\", \"type\": \"task\", \"fix\": \"Consider improving the task response aspect here.\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Develop your main arguments more fully with specific examples.\", \"Ensure you address all parts of the question directly.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Coherence & Cohesion\", \"band\": 3.5, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"In the contemporary days a lot of cities experiencing dramatic growth\", \"Additionally,they came up with idea to provides convenient way to get job from village\", \"After thorough analysis on this subject, it is predicted that after moving some people in villages, housing shortage will be adjusted\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"In the contemporary days a lot of cities experiencing dramatic growth\", \"type\": \"coherence\", \"fix\": \"Consider improving the coherence & cohesion aspect here.\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Use more varied linking words to connect your ideas.\", \"Improve paragraph structure with clearer topic sentences.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Lexical Resource\", \"band\": 3.5, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"In the contemporary days a lot of cities experiencing dramatic growth\", \"Additionally,they came up with idea to provides convenient way to get job from village\", \"After thorough analysis on this subject, it is predicted that after moving some people in villages, housing shortage will be adjusted\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"In the contemporary days a lot of cities experiencing dramatic growth\", \"type\": \"lexical\", \"fix\": \"Consider improving the lexical resource aspect here.\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Use more sophisticated vocabulary and avoid repetition.\", \"Focus on precise word choice and natural collocations.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Grammatical Range & Accuracy\", \"band\": 4.5, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"In the contemporary days a lot of cities experiencing dramatic growth\", \"Additionally,they came up with idea to provides convenient way to get job from village\", \"After thorough analysis on this subject, it is predicted that after moving some people in villages, housing shortage will be adjusted\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"In the contemporary days a lot of cities experiencing dramatic growth\", \"type\": \"grammar\", \"fix\": \"Consider improving the grammatical range & accuracy aspect here.\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Use more complex sentence structures.\", \"Check for grammatical errors and improve accuracy.\"]}], \"overall\": 4.0, \"votes\": [4.0, 4.0, 4.0], \"dispersion\": 0.0, \"confidence\": \"high\", \"meta\": {\"prompt_hash\": \"training_data\", \"model\": \"training\", \"schema_version\": \"v1\", \"rubric_version\": \"rubric/v1\", \"token_usage\": {\"input_tokens\": 378, \"output_tokens\": 500}}}"}]}

For example, children fall into the habit sedentary lifestyle that is a highly detrimental effect on physical health. In addition, decrease outdoors and physical activities for youngsters, the more significant issue of excessive watching tv impairs social communication abilities of children; besides, they reluctant to be in relation with others in their real life, so children find it hard to play and live with others. Consequently, watching tv in a long time can change the normal behaviour of children and that a have a destructive influence on them.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, without regard to the length of time that youngster consume to watching TV that have evil impact on them, watching movies and images on television can have a bad effect of children’s behavior. Some countries tv shows glamourized depictions of inappropriate products and behavior such as drug addict and violence; thus, it may adopt unhealthy habits. For instance, youngster by watching violence movies encourage them to have a harsh behavior and children persuade to drink alcohol and use drug is fashionable, without being aware to health risk.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, although both factors play a vital role to have an effect on children's behavior, but I personally believe watching TV particularly in a long time have a most considerable impact on them.

In my opinion, I disagree with this view.\n\nThere are various measures that governments and individuals can take to prevent, or at least mitigate. For example, the governments can introduce laws to limit the carbon dioxide emissions that cause global warming. And they can impose “green taxes” on drivers, airline companies and other polluters and invest in renewable energy production which use solar, wind or water power. In addition, individuals should limit our contribution to climate change. We can become more energy efficient , such as flying less, using bicycles and public transport.

Discuss the causes and how to solve this problem.\n\nScore this IELTS Task 2 essay according to the rubric, ensuring alignment with the question:\n\nRecently, the number of young people who offend the law is increasing in many big cities. There are many reasons that result in this phenomenon, varying from one country to another. Two main factors and appropriate solutions will be indicated further in the following part of this essay.\r\n\r\nTo begin with, a negative family environment and pressure from social and school life seem to be two main reasons for the rise of jubilant offenders. Firstly, toxic backgrounds can lead kids to  inappropriate actions that are socially unacceptable or morally wrong. For example, if parents are alcoholics or workaholics and, as a result, they will not spend enough time with their children, kids tend to commit crimes to draw their parents’ attention. Secondly, due to enormous stress, teenagers commit a felony as a way to get some excitement or feel  control over their life. To illustrate this idea, many youths do vandalism or shoplift useless items just for fun. To sum up, the elevation of youth crimes tends to result from both domestic and social impacts.\r\n\r\nTo reduce  juvenile delinquency, it is necessary to focus on young people’s lives both at home and at school. On the one hand, parents should be considerate by paying more attention to what kids are doing and how they feel. On the other hand, youngsters should be encouraged to learn what they are good at so they can be more confident about their futures. In conclusion, both parents and education staff play an important role to solve the rising number of young law-breakers.\r\n\r\nTo abridge, the rise of youth crimes can be linked to factors at home and at school.

Some people stated that due to differences in physical features as well as abilities, women are limited to taking on the so-called men’s occupation and vice versa. However, in my opinion, it is unjust to bear such stereotype in mind due to the reasons as follow. \r\nFirstly, broad generalization about characteristics of men and women create public’s misconceptions on people’s ability in their suitable careers. Though it is evident that men and women do not share common characteristics, there are still exceptions in terms of human abilities. For example, the majority of people would consider politicians be male rather than female; nevertheless, talented female governors starts to prove their excellent ability in the political field as time pass by. Therefore, people’s decision on their career does not based on their gender but their passion and capacity.\r\nSecondly, gender equality in workplace would provide a more balanced working environment. As a matter of fact, each gender has a distinct way of processing information, hence people can broaden their knowledge by taking opposite gender’s approach to an issue into consideration. If men are more of a logical thinking creature, women on the other hand, will have the tendency toward creativity. By combining two of these aspects, a sense of balance at workplace is likely to remains stably. \r\nIn conclusion, despite the gap between men and women’s characteristics, people are doubtlessly have all rights to pursue their desire career and should not be discouraged from picking their occupation regarding their gender.\n\nProvide your assessment in the specified JSON format."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"per_criterion\": [{\"name\": \"Task Response\", \"band\": 7.0, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"In the modern era, existing stereotypical prejudices about conventional gender role has been a debatable issue for some decades\", \"Therefore, people’s decision on their career does not based on their gender but their passion and capacity\", \"In conclusion, despite the gap between men and women’s characteristics, people are doubtlessly have all rights to pursue their desire career and should not be discouraged from picking their occupation regarding their gender\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"In the modern era, existing stereotypical prejudices about conventional gender role has been a debat\", \"type\": \"task\", \"fix\": \"Consider improving the task response aspect here.\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Develop your main arguments more fully with specific examples.\", \"Ensure you address all parts of the question directly.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Coherence & Cohesion\", \"band\": 6.0, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"In the modern era, existing stereotypical prejudices about conventional gender role has been a debatable issue for some decades\", \"Therefore, people’s decision on their career does not based on their gender but their passion and capacity\", \"In conclusion, despite the gap between men and women’s characteristics, people are doubtlessly have all rights to pursue their desire career and should not be discouraged from picking their occupation regarding their gender\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"In the modern era, existing stereotypical prejudices about conventional gender role has been a debat\", \"type\": \"coherence\", \"fix\": \"Consider improving the coherence & cohesion aspect here.\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Use more varied linking words to connect your ideas.\", \"Improve paragraph structure with clearer topic sentences.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Lexical Resource\", \"band\": 6.0, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"In the modern era, existing stereotypical prejudices about conventional gender role has been a debatable issue for some decades\", \"Therefore, people’s decision on their career does not based on their gender but their passion and capacity\", \"In conclusion, despite the gap between men and women’s characteristics, people are doubtlessly have all rights to pursue their desire career and should not be discouraged from picking their occupation regarding their gender\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"In the modern era, existing stereotypical prejudices about conventional gender role has been a debat\", \"type\": \"lexical\", \"fix\": \"Consider improving the lexical resource aspect here.\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Use more sophisticated vocabulary and avoid repetition.\", \"Focus on precise word choice and natural collocations.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Grammatical Range & Accuracy\", \"band\": 7.0, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"In the modern era, existing stereotypical prejudices about conventional gender role has been a debatable issue for some decades\", \"Therefore, people’s decision on their career does not based on their gender but their passion and capacity\", \"In conclusion, despite the gap between men and women’s characteristics, people are doubtlessly have all rights to pursue their desire career and should not be discouraged from picking their occupation regarding their gender\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"In the modern era, existing stereotypical prejudices about conventional gender role has been a debat\", \"type\": \"grammar\", \"fix\": \"Consider improving the grammatical range & accuracy aspect here.\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Use more complex sentence structures.\", \"Check for grammatical errors and improve accuracy.\"]}], \"overall\": 6.5, \"votes\": [6.5, 6.5, 6.5], \"dispersion\": 0.0, \"confidence\": \"high\", \"meta\": {\"prompt_hash\": \"training_data\", \"model\": \"training\", \"schema_version\": \"v1\", \"rubric_version\": \"rubric/v1\", \"token_usage\": {\"input_tokens\": 298, \"output_tokens\": 500}}}"}]}

For example, Tasks that are routine and repetitive could be delegated to machines, allowing human workers to focus on more complex and creative aspects of their jobs. For this reason, AI technologies could contribute to the development of new industries, creating novel employment opportunities that cater to the evolving needs of society.\r\n\r\nHowever, it is essential to acknowledge the challenges associated with widespread automation.

In recent times, some individuals decide to give birth at a later age. Although there are some benefits attached to that, such as mental and emotional maturity, as well as financial stability, however, there are also risks of having a baby with deformity, not being able to give children optimum parenting due to unavailability, which I believe outweigh the benefits. \r\n\r\nTo begin, so many people in this modern society would rather prefer to pursue their career first, get a job and have a steady income before venturing into marriage and childbearing. Their reason is that it makes it very easy to train the children without having to face the challenges of finance, as such children mostly lack nothing. For instance, when one is financially buoyant, they can afford to train their children to any level of education. More so, some people also think that it’s better to be mentally mature enough to be able to face the emotional ups and downs that come with childbearing and parenting. \r\n\r\nOn the other hand, as some people are busy pursuing their careers, they tend to forget that age is not on their side, hence old age increases one’s chances of giving birth to abnormal babies. Furthermore, when parents are busy  and so engulfed with their job, they have little or no time to monitor their youngsters and attend to their needs. In addition, early retirement age might catch up with one, thereby affecting their income, and besides, old age comes with weakness and poses the risk of lack of energy required to control children. For instance, an elderly man who has  a two-year-old toddler would find it tasking to walk the baby around the house.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, in as much as there are advantages to early childbearing and upbringing such as a steady income, and mental and emotional maturity, the disadvantages which include, lack of availability due to busy schedules, and having babies with congenital anomalies exceed the advantages.\n\nProvide your assessment in the specified JSON format."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"per_criterion\": [{\"name\": \"Task Response\", \"band\": 6.5, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"Most people’s dream is to have children of their own\", \"More so, some people also think that it’s better to be mentally mature enough to be able to face the emotional ups and downs that come with childbearing and parenting\", \"In conclusion, in as much as there are advantages to early childbearing and upbringing such as a steady income, and mental and emotional maturity, the disadvantages which include, lack of availability due to busy schedules, and having babies with congenital anomalies exceed the advantages\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"Most people’s dream is to have children of their own\", \"type\": \"task\", \"fix\": \"Consider improving the task response aspect here.\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Develop your main arguments more fully with specific examples.\", \"Ensure you address all parts of the question directly.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Coherence & Cohesion\", \"band\": 5.5, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"Most people’s dream is to have children of their own\", \"More so, some people also think that it’s better to be mentally mature enough to be able to face the emotional ups and downs that come with childbearing and parenting\", \"In conclusion, in as much as there are advantages to early childbearing and upbringing such as a steady income, and mental and emotional maturity, the disadvantages which include, lack of availability due to busy schedules, and having babies with congenital anomalies exceed the advantages\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"Most people’s dream is to have children of their own\", \"type\": \"coherence\", \"fix\": \"Consider improving the coherence & cohesion aspect here.\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Use more varied linking words to connect your ideas.\", \"Improve paragraph structure with clearer topic sentences.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Lexical Resource\", \"band\": 5.5, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"Most people’s dream is to have children of their own\", \"More so, some people also think that it’s better to be mentally mature enough to be able to face the emotional ups and downs that come with childbearing and parenting\", \"In conclusion, in as much as there are advantages to early childbearing and upbringing such as a steady income, and mental and emotional maturity, the disadvantages which include, lack of availability due to busy schedules, and having babies with congenital anomalies exceed the advantages\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"Most people’s dream is to have children of their own\", \"type\": \"lexical\", \"fix\": \"Consider improving the lexical resource aspect here.\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Use more sophisticated vocabulary and avoid repetition.\", \"Focus on precise word choice and natural collocations.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Grammatical Range & Accuracy\", \"band\": 6.5, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"Most people’s dream is to have children of their own\", \"More so, some people also think that it’s better to be mentally mature enough to be able to face the emotional ups and downs that come with childbearing and parenting\", \"In conclusion, in as much as there are advantages to early childbearing and upbringing such as a steady income, and mental and emotional maturity, the disadvantages which include, lack of availability due to busy schedules, and having babies with congenital anomalies exceed the advantages\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"Most people’s dream is to have children of their own\", \"type\": \"grammar\", \"fix\": \"Consider improving the grammatical range & accuracy aspect here.\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Use more complex sentence structures.\", \"Check for grammatical errors and improve accuracy.\"]}], \"overall\": 6.0, \"votes\": [6.0, 6.0, 6.0], \"dispersion\": 0.0, \"confidence\": \"high\", \"meta\": {\"prompt_hash\": \"training_data\", \"model\": \"training\", \"schema_version\": \"v1\", \"rubric_version\": \"rubric/v1\", \"token_usage\": {\"input_tokens\": 351, \"output_tokens\": 500}}}"}]}

This has pushed marriage and childbirth to a later age in their list of priorities. But It has a few disadvantages in its bucket. Firstly, the stressful life has major effects on the health of parents, especially the mother and this has adverse effects on child and mother’s conditions during childbirth. Secondly, the late delivery of the first baby restricts the chances for a second child as the mother’s age and health complicate the situation. Moreover, it can be upsetting for kids as well, for example, the kid grows in an environment with no siblings and working parents.\nOn the contrary, this has advantages for the children. Parents are very conscious to provide the best life to their children. Although parents give birth at a later stage of life, they make sure that they are well settled and have enough earnings to take care of the baby. The new generation parents want their kids to have a happy life with no financial struggles which they faced themselves while growing up. Clearly, this enhances the children’s lives and they can explore more to face the challenging life, for instance, they get a better education.\nIn conclusion, giving birth at an older age has its pros and cons, but in my opinion, the advantages fail to outweigh the disadvantages as children growing with siblings have a happier and satisfied life.\n\nProvide your assessment in the specified JSON format."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"per_criterion\": [{\"name\": \"Task Response\", \"band\": 6.5, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"In the past, the parents used to give birth to children at very early stages of their married life\", \"Secondly, the late delivery of the first baby restricts the chances for a second child as the mother’s age and health complicate the situation\", \"In conclusion, giving birth at an older age has its pros and cons, but in my opinion, the advantages fail to outweigh the disadvantages as children growing with siblings have a happier and satisfied life\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"In the past, the parents used to give birth to children at very early stages of their married life\", \"type\": \"task\", \"fix\": \"Consider improving the task response aspect here.\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Develop your main arguments more fully with specific examples.\", \"Ensure you address all parts of the question directly.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Coherence & Cohesion\", \"band\": 5.5, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"In the past, the parents used to give birth to children at very early stages of their married life\", \"Secondly, the late delivery of the first baby restricts the chances for a second child as the mother’s age and health complicate the situation\", \"In conclusion, giving birth at an older age has its pros and cons, but in my opinion, the advantages fail to outweigh the disadvantages as children growing with siblings have a happier and satisfied life\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"In the past, the parents used to give birth to children at very early stages of their married life\", \"type\": \"coherence\", \"fix\": \"Consider improving the coherence & cohesion aspect here.\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Use more varied linking words to connect your ideas.\", \"Improve paragraph structure with clearer topic sentences.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Lexical Resource\", \"band\": 5.5, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"In the past, the parents used to give birth to children at very early stages of their married life\", \"Secondly, the late delivery of the first baby restricts the chances for a second child as the mother’s age and health complicate the situation\", \"In conclusion, giving birth at an older age has its pros and cons, but in my opinion, the advantages fail to outweigh the disadvantages as children growing with siblings have a happier and satisfied life\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"In the past, the parents used to give birth to children at very early stages of their married life\", \"type\": \"lexical\", \"fix\": \"Consider improving the lexical resource aspect here.\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Use more sophisticated vocabulary and avoid repetition.\", \"Focus on precise word choice and natural collocations.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Grammatical Range & Accuracy\", \"band\": 6.5, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"In the past, the parents used to give birth to children at very early stages of their married life\", \"Secondly, the late delivery of the first baby restricts the chances for a second child as the mother’s age and health complicate the situation\", \"In conclusion, giving birth at an older age has its pros and cons, but in my opinion, the advantages fail to outweigh the disadvantages as children growing with siblings have a happier and satisfied life\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"In the past, the parents used to give birth to children at very early stages of their married life\", \"type\": \"grammar\", \"fix\": \"Consider improving the grammatical range & accuracy aspect here.\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Use more complex sentence structures.\", \"Check for grammatical errors and improve accuracy.\"]}], \"overall\": 6.0, \"votes\": [6.0, 6.0, 6.0], \"dispersion\": 0.0, \"confidence\": \"high\", \"meta\": {\"prompt_hash\": \"training_data\", \"model\": \"training\", \"schema_version\": \"v1\", \"rubric_version\": \"rubric/v1\", \"token_usage\": {\"input_tokens\": 310, \"output_tokens\": 500}}}"}]}

Many argue that we need to take radical actions to avoid erratic weather while others are complacent about it. From my perspective, we need to put in efforts to mitigate this issue before it's exacerbated. I will share my viewpoint in the upcoming paragraphs\n\nTo commence with, the carbon footprint should be monitored across all the nations. In other words, the government officials could impose penalties on the citizens crossing the threshold of carbon limits. Consequently, individuals would consciously change their lifestyles. For instance, for commuting, they may switch from private to public transportation. Thus, this will purge emissions in some quantities and help in tackling extreme weather issues.\n\nFurthermore, schools should focus on  environmental studies. To elaborate on this, if adolescents are aware of the rising problems as shared by their teachers about irregular temperature then they will feel responsible towards the environment. For example, a tree plantation drive or a beach clean-up could  help teenagers to be accountable. Hence, with their mindful behaviour, preventing climate change will be easier.\n\nTo sum up, we can avert the effects on weather by reducing the release of carbon dioxide gases. The government can impose penalties on those who don't abide by the rules.

When supporters suppose authorities ought to offer support to people who engage in industries that are based on art. However, opponents reckon that money should be poured into other fields. Personally, there are several reasons and instance as follows supporting my view.\r\n\r\nSupporters of providing assistance to art field argue that an increasing number of artworks need protecting and developing. Providing help to art will attract more people and create many job opportunities. What’s more, this would give the people a sense of happiness.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, other people believe that other domains, such as medical system and educational, are vital than using money in art because residents cannot bear the pressure of education and medical due to lower salaries and without medical insurance in some developing nations. If the government financial them, they no longer worry about the fees when they are ill. \r\n\r\nIn my opinion, whether a country should provide assistance access to all sorts of artists depends on its financial and nation’s culture.

However, I completely disagree with this opinion.\r\n\r\nI believe that only determined and industrious people will be successful in whatever they do. Hard-working people usually attain their goals. For instance, Steve Jobs spent thousands of hours coding and experimenting to bring out the great Macintosh operating system that we use nowadays. Another clear case of success through determination is Nick Vujicic, an Australian motivational speaker, who suffered from a rare disorder which resulted in the absence of four limbs. Despite not having any hands or legs, Vujicic earned a bachelor degree with a double major in accountancy and financial planning; he had his own family, and now he travels around the world inspiring people as a motivational speaker.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, by contrast, luck is only a small factor in determining one’s achievement. Firstly, people cannot solely be dependent on luck to become successful. If a student does not study for an exam, chances are he or she will fail, no matter how lucky he or she may be. Secondly, luck only contributes to short term fortune. For instance, a person who wins a lottery is definitely lucky because winning a lottery does not require you to do anything to earn it. It purely depends on luck; yet, he or she cannot win the lottery for the rest of his or her life.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, for the reasons I have mentioned above, I strongly believe that in order to achieve objectives in life, one must be extremely determined and hard working to follow his or her passion till the end.\n\nProvide your assessment in the specified JSON format."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"per_criterion\": [{\"name\": \"Task Response\", \"band\": 8.0, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"It is argued that some people’s success is mostly attributable to luck instead of their own hard work\", \"On the other hand, by contrast, luck is only a small factor in determining one’s achievement\", \"In conclusion, for the reasons I have mentioned above, I strongly believe that in order to achieve objectives in life, one must be extremely determined and hard working to follow his or her passion till the end\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"It is argued that some people’s success is mostly attributable to luck instead of their own hard wor\", \"type\": \"task\", \"fix\": \"Consider improving the task response aspect here.\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Develop your main arguments more fully with specific examples.\", \"Ensure you address all parts of the question directly.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Coherence & Cohesion\", \"band\": 7.0, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"It is argued that some people’s success is mostly attributable to luck instead of their own hard work\", \"On the other hand, by contrast, luck is only a small factor in determining one’s achievement\", \"In conclusion, for the reasons I have mentioned above, I strongly believe that in order to achieve objectives in life, one must be extremely determined and hard working to follow his or her passion till the end\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"It is argued that some people’s success is mostly attributable to luck instead of their own hard wor\", \"type\": \"coherence\", \"fix\": \"Consider improving the coherence & cohesion aspect here.\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Use more varied linking words to connect your ideas.\", \"Improve paragraph structure with clearer topic sentences.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Lexical Resource\", \"band\": 7.0, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"It is argued that some people’s success is mostly attributable to luck instead of their own hard work\", \"On the other hand, by contrast, luck is only a small factor in determining one’s achievement\", \"In conclusion, for the reasons I have mentioned above, I strongly believe that in order to achieve objectives in life, one must be extremely determined and hard working to follow his or her passion till the end\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"It is argued that some people’s success is mostly attributable to luck instead of their own hard wor\", \"type\": \"lexical\", \"fix\": \"Consider improving the lexical resource aspect here.\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Use more sophisticated vocabulary and avoid repetition.\", \"Focus on precise word choice and natural collocations.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Grammatical Range & Accuracy\", \"band\": 8.0, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"It is argued that some people’s success is mostly attributable to luck instead of their own hard work\", \"On the other hand, by contrast, luck is only a small factor in determining one’s achievement\", \"In conclusion, for the reasons I have mentioned above, I strongly believe that in order to achieve objectives in life, one must be extremely determined and hard working to follow his or her passion till the end\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"It is argued that some people’s success is mostly attributable to luck instead of their own hard wor\", \"type\": \"grammar\", \"fix\": \"Consider improving the grammatical range & accuracy aspect here.\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Use more complex sentence structures.\", \"Check for grammatical errors and improve accuracy.\"]}], \"overall\": 7.5, \"votes\": [7.5, 7.5, 7.5], \"dispersion\": 0.0, \"confidence\": \"high\", \"meta\": {\"prompt_hash\": \"training_data\", \"model\": \"training\", \"schema_version\": \"v1\", \"rubric_version\": \"rubric/v1\", \"token_usage\": {\"input_tokens\": 301, \"output_tokens\": 500}}}"}]}

In recent times, some individuals decide to give birth at a later age. Although there are some benefits attached to that, such as, mental and emotional maturity, as well as financial stability, there are also risks of having a baby with deformity, not being able to give children optimum parenting due to lack physical fitness, unavailability, which I believe outweigh the benefits. \r\n\r\nTo begin, so many people in this modern society would rather prefer to pursue their career first, get a job and have a steady income before venturing into marriage and childbearing. Their reason is that it makes it very easy to train the children without having to face the challenges of finance, as such children mostly lack nothing. For instance, when one is financially buoyant, they can afford to train their children to any level of education. More so, some people also think that it’s better to be mentally mature enough to be able to face emotional ups and downs that come with childbearing and parenting. \r\n\r\nOn the other hand, as some people are busy pursuing their careers, they tend to forget that age is not on their side, hence old age increases one’s chances of giving birth to abnormal babies. Furthermore, when parents are busy  and so engulfed with their job, they have little or no time to monitor their youngsters and attend to their needs. In addition, early retirement age might catch up with one, thereby affecting their income, and besides, old age comes with weakness and poses the risk of lack energy required to control children. For instance, an elderly man who has  a two year old toddler would find it tasking to walk the baby around the house.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, in as much as there are advantages to early child bearing and upbringing such as a steady income, mental and emotional maturity, the disadvantages which includes, lack of availability due to busy schedules, having babies with congenital anomalies exceed the advantages.\n\nProvide your assessment in the specified JSON format."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"per_criterion\": [{\"name\": \"Task Response\", \"band\": 5.5, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"Most people’s dream is to have children of their own\", \"More so, some people also think that it’s better to be mentally mature enough to be able to face emotional ups and downs that come with childbearing and parenting\", \"In conclusion, in as much as there are advantages to early child bearing and upbringing such as a steady income, mental and emotional maturity, the disadvantages which includes, lack of availability due to busy schedules, having babies with congenital anomalies exceed the advantages\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"Most people’s dream is to have children of their own\", \"type\": \"task\", \"fix\": \"Consider improving the task response aspect here.\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Develop your main arguments more fully with specific examples.\", \"Ensure you address all parts of the question directly.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Coherence & Cohesion\", \"band\": 4.5, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"Most people’s dream is to have children of their own\", \"More so, some people also think that it’s better to be mentally mature enough to be able to face emotional ups and downs that come with childbearing and parenting\", \"In conclusion, in as much as there are advantages to early child bearing and upbringing such as a steady income, mental and emotional maturity, the disadvantages which includes, lack of availability due to busy schedules, having babies with congenital anomalies exceed the advantages\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"Most people’s dream is to have children of their own\", \"type\": \"coherence\", \"fix\": \"Consider improving the coherence & cohesion aspect here.\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Use more varied linking words to connect your ideas.\", \"Improve paragraph structure with clearer topic sentences.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Lexical Resource\", \"band\": 4.5, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"Most people’s dream is to have children of their own\", \"More so, some people also think that it’s better to be mentally mature enough to be able to face emotional ups and downs that come with childbearing and parenting\", \"In conclusion, in as much as there are advantages to early child bearing and upbringing such as a steady income, mental and emotional maturity, the disadvantages which includes, lack of availability due to busy schedules, having babies with congenital anomalies exceed the advantages\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"Most people’s dream is to have children of their own\", \"type\": \"lexical\", \"fix\": \"Consider improving the lexical resource aspect here.\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Use more sophisticated vocabulary and avoid repetition.\", \"Focus on precise word choice and natural collocations.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Grammatical Range & Accuracy\", \"band\": 5.5, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"Most people’s dream is to have children of their own\", \"More so, some people also think that it’s better to be mentally mature enough to be able to face emotional ups and downs that come with childbearing and parenting\", \"In conclusion, in as much as there are advantages to early child bearing and upbringing such as a steady income, mental and emotional maturity, the disadvantages which includes, lack of availability due to busy schedules, having babies with congenital anomalies exceed the advantages\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"Most people’s dream is to have children of their own\", \"type\": \"grammar\", \"fix\": \"Consider improving the grammatical range & accuracy aspect here.\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Use more complex sentence structures.\", \"Check for grammatical errors and improve accuracy.\"]}], \"overall\": 5.0, \"votes\": [5.0, 5.0, 5.0], \"dispersion\": 0.0, \"confidence\": \"high\", \"meta\": {\"prompt_hash\": \"training_data\", \"model\": \"training\", \"schema_version\": \"v1\", \"rubric_version\": \"rubric/v1\", \"token_usage\": {\"input_tokens\": 352, \"output_tokens\": 500}}}"}]}

In this essay, I will discuss the positive sides of the the given statement as well as the negative sides. Firstly, I will explore the way art affects the creativity of the children. Secondly, I will discuss the time waste by children who are not interested in art and would like to focus on different subjects.\r\n\r\nIn my opinion, the art improves the imagination of the children and shapes their future. Furthermore, some lectures such as theatre and music help kids to socialize and make new friends at school age. For instance, many young people are introverted during the first years of their studies. Therefore, art courses at elementary school encourage them to be more extroverted in their social life throughout the beginning of the education years.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, not every kid should be forced to take the same art classes because some might have completely different desires.

One of these is because of the detrimental effects that would bring to the human populace. A good example of this is depletion of the ozone layer due to pollution, which may possibly lead to the occurrence of some certain types of cancer. If nothing is done to deal with climate change, the society in general may suffer. \n\nFurthermore, another reason why climate change should be prevented is because of the harmful consequences it may have on livestocks and plants. For instance, some plant growth may be disrupted by toxic gases. Consequently, this would result in the disruption of the food chain. \n\nHowever, people who believe that we should live with climate change have argued that some of its causes are not man-made. Hence, it is beyond human control. \n\nTo sum up, although some of the causes of climate change are not as a result of man's action or inaction, I still agree that it should be prevented in our own capacities.

To a certain extent, I agree with this opinion, however, I also think that base on the work’s properties, the staff should choose an outfit suitable for this job.\nOn the one hand, there is a good reason why a number of individuals think that wear is unnecessary. First of all, there are jobs that do not require dressing up because it does not yield any positive effect on work. Some technology companies like Google or Facebook are famous for their relaxed dress code. They aim to create an informal, fun and creative environment. Some jobs such as website designers, programmer, that always just sit at their working desk and look to the laptop screen and file paper all their working time, so they usually do not care about the dress that they wear. Secondly, these occupations do not involve meeting customer or partner, therefore, it should be made free for employees as what to wear a comfortable dress to work. \nOn the other hand, numerous people hold the notion that staff should take dressing style into full consideration. These may work in the sectors that require workers to dress up smartly and professional upfront workers like receptionist, teacher, doctor, etc who meet others face-to-face wherein one’s attire may leave either good or bad impressions. In these situations, even though how you present yourself with your fashion preference may not directly affect how you carry out your responsibilities, it could affect social interaction which are important in such jobs.\nIn conclusion, although one’s clothing preference or dress code at work does not directly productivity, its relevance is worth considering depending on the nature of work. \n\n\nProvide your assessment in the specified JSON format."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"per_criterion\": [{\"name\": \"Task Response\", \"band\": 7.0, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"In contemporary society, the dress code at work is not significant since it does not directly influence work productivity\", \"They aim to create an informal, fun and creative environment\", \"In conclusion, although one’s clothing preference or dress code at work does not directly productivity, its relevance is worth considering depending on the nature of work\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"In contemporary society, the dress code at work is not significant since it does not directly influe\", \"type\": \"task\", \"fix\": \"Consider improving the task response aspect here.\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Develop your main arguments more fully with specific examples.\", \"Ensure you address all parts of the question directly.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Coherence & Cohesion\", \"band\": 6.0, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"In contemporary society, the dress code at work is not significant since it does not directly influence work productivity\", \"They aim to create an informal, fun and creative environment\", \"In conclusion, although one’s clothing preference or dress code at work does not directly productivity, its relevance is worth considering depending on the nature of work\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"In contemporary society, the dress code at work is not significant since it does not directly influe\", \"type\": \"coherence\", \"fix\": \"Consider improving the coherence & cohesion aspect here.\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Use more varied linking words to connect your ideas.\", \"Improve paragraph structure with clearer topic sentences.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Lexical Resource\", \"band\": 6.0, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"In contemporary society, the dress code at work is not significant since it does not directly influence work productivity\", \"They aim to create an informal, fun and creative environment\", \"In conclusion, although one’s clothing preference or dress code at work does not directly productivity, its relevance is worth considering depending on the nature of work\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"In contemporary society, the dress code at work is not significant since it does not directly influe\", \"type\": \"lexical\", \"fix\": \"Consider improving the lexical resource aspect here.\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Use more sophisticated vocabulary and avoid repetition.\", \"Focus on precise word choice and natural collocations.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Grammatical Range & Accuracy\", \"band\": 7.0, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"In contemporary society, the dress code at work is not significant since it does not directly influence work productivity\", \"They aim to create an informal, fun and creative environment\", \"In conclusion, although one’s clothing preference or dress code at work does not directly productivity, its relevance is worth considering depending on the nature of work\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"In contemporary society, the dress code at work is not significant since it does not directly influe\", \"type\": \"grammar\", \"fix\": \"Consider improving the grammatical range & accuracy aspect here.\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Use more complex sentence structures.\", \"Check for grammatical errors and improve accuracy.\"]}], \"overall\": 6.5, \"votes\": [6.5, 6.5, 6.5], \"dispersion\": 0.0, \"confidence\": \"high\", \"meta\": {\"prompt_hash\": \"training_data\", \"model\": \"training\", \"schema_version\": \"v1\", \"rubric_version\": \"rubric/v1\", \"token_usage\": {\"input_tokens\": 346, \"output_tokens\": 500}}}"}]}

Moreover, robots are ideal in  jobs where human lives can be saved.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, we want to extend the advantages of our inventions and try to implement benefits in all possible ways. But it may not be feasible at all times. For example, a robot cannot replace a mother or a teacher. Robot's do not have any natural emotions which are required while performing certain jobs. A robot cannot take its own  decision to avert  damage or decide if a drive can be postponed, in case of heavy rain. Humans are good at taking a stand based on the situation they are in.

To what extent do you agree or disagree?\n\nScore this IELTS Task 2 essay according to the rubric, ensuring alignment with the question:\n\nSome individuals argue that nations should prioritize financial investments in skills and vocational training for practical work over higher education. While I acknowledge the validity of this viewpoint to some extent, I firmly believe that higher education encompasses more essential considerations than professional training.\r\n\r\nOn one hand, advocating for the option of direct training carries certain advantages. A notable benefit is a potential reduction in study time due to the exclusion of certain academic subjects in shorter training programs. Unlike traditional university education, which typically spans at least four years, these training courses can be completed within one to two years. Consequently, many students are able to embark on their professional careers at an earlier stage compared to their peers. Moreover, this approach allows students to gain firsthand experience in their intended fields, aiding in the identification of their strengths and weaknesses, ultimately enabling them to chart a suitable career path.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, numerous compelling reasons support my conviction that high school graduates should choose to pursue higher education. Firstly, students need a comprehensive understanding of the nature of their future work and its broader implications for areas such as the environment or human life. For instance, students majoring in Information Technology require in-depth knowledge to decipher complex algorithms, including concepts rooted in mathematics and statistical probabilities. Such proficiency would be challenging to acquire within the limited study schedules of immediate training courses. Secondly, possessing a degree plays a crucial role in ensuring the future advancement of young individuals.

In this essay, I discuss about the possible reasons behind this ever-rising problem and how can be tackled in an effective way.\r\n\r\nDefinitely, the first and foremost for the traffic jam is the increasing number of vehicles on the road. Nowadays, most of the commuters relay on their own cars to reach their destinations. They think that it would save their precious time, unfortunately it makes congested roads. In order to resolve this matter, the government has to implement frequent public transport system at reasonable cost at anytime and anywhere. For example, the government introducesthe train which helps people to travel anywhere in the state . It's name is Vandhe Barath which saves time to travel long distances.\r\n\r\nThe second reason for the traffic congestion is the neverending road works which makes the queues of vehicles on the road. In Kochi, one of the busiest cities in India, construction of flyovers, pipe line installation etc do at peak hours, as a result, it leads to traffic jams. The best solution for this problem is that works on the road should be done at non-peak hours and travellers should be notify in advance. Such ways help to reduce the intensity of traffic block \r\n\r\nIn conclusion, traffic congestion is an ever-rising concern in major cities due to increasing number of vehicles and road works, it should be handle with possible solutions like introduction of more public transport and less busy hours road works.\n\nProvide your assessment in the specified JSON format."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"per_criterion\": [{\"name\": \"Task Response\", \"band\": 5.5, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"Undoubtedly, it is true that traffic congestion is a concerning issue in cities and towns around the world\", \"For example, the government introducesthe train which helps people to travel anywhere in the state\", \"Such ways help to reduce the intensity of traffic block \\r\\n\\r\\nIn conclusion, traffic congestion is an ever-rising concern in major cities due to increasing number of vehicles and road works, it should be handle with possible solutions like introduction of more public transport and less busy hours road works\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"Undoubtedly, it is true that traffic congestion is a concerning issue in cities and towns around the\", \"type\": \"task\", \"fix\": \"Consider improving the task response aspect here.\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Develop your main arguments more fully with specific examples.\", \"Ensure you address all parts of the question directly.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Coherence & Cohesion\", \"band\": 4.5, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"Undoubtedly, it is true that traffic congestion is a concerning issue in cities and towns around the world\", \"For example, the government introducesthe train which helps people to travel anywhere in the state\", \"Such ways help to reduce the intensity of traffic block \\r\\n\\r\\nIn conclusion, traffic congestion is an ever-rising concern in major cities due to increasing number of vehicles and road works, it should be handle with possible solutions like introduction of more public transport and less busy hours road works\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"Undoubtedly, it is true that traffic congestion is a concerning issue in cities and towns around the\", \"type\": \"coherence\", \"fix\": \"Consider improving the coherence & cohesion aspect here.\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Use more varied linking words to connect your ideas.\", \"Improve paragraph structure with clearer topic sentences.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Lexical Resource\", \"band\": 4.5, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"Undoubtedly, it is true that traffic congestion is a concerning issue in cities and towns around the world\", \"For example, the government introducesthe train which helps people to travel anywhere in the state\", \"Such ways help to reduce the intensity of traffic block \\r\\n\\r\\nIn conclusion, traffic congestion is an ever-rising concern in major cities due to increasing number of vehicles and road works, it should be handle with possible solutions like introduction of more public transport and less busy hours road works\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"Undoubtedly, it is true that traffic congestion is a concerning issue in cities and towns around the\", \"type\": \"lexical\", \"fix\": \"Consider improving the lexical resource aspect here.\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Use more sophisticated vocabulary and avoid repetition.\", \"Focus on precise word choice and natural collocations.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Grammatical Range & Accuracy\", \"band\": 5.5, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"Undoubtedly, it is true that traffic congestion is a concerning issue in cities and towns around the world\", \"For example, the government introducesthe train which helps people to travel anywhere in the state\", \"Such ways help to reduce the intensity of traffic block \\r\\n\\r\\nIn conclusion, traffic congestion is an ever-rising concern in major cities due to increasing number of vehicles and road works, it should be handle with possible solutions like introduction of more public transport and less busy hours road works\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"Undoubtedly, it is true that traffic congestion is a concerning issue in cities and towns around the\", \"type\": \"grammar\", \"fix\": \"Consider improving the grammatical range & accuracy aspect here.\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Use more complex sentence structures.\", \"Check for grammatical errors and improve accuracy.\"]}], \"overall\": 5.0, \"votes\": [5.0, 5.0, 5.0], \"dispersion\": 0.0, \"confidence\": \"high\", \"meta\": {\"prompt_hash\": \"training_data\", \"model\": \"training\", \"schema_version\": \"v1\", \"rubric_version\": \"rubric/v1\", \"token_usage\": {\"input_tokens\": 291, \"output_tokens\": 500}}}"}]}

renovation of older structures.Additionally,invest on building new living spaces, provide accomodation for local individuals.This essay will discuss both views.\n\nAncient buildings made in the era of our forefathers inculcates heritage and convey cultural values to the upcoming generation.Therefore, renovation of the buildings has become neccessity to keep the heritage alive and keep them intact so it could not demolish by any means of disaster.Moreover these can be source of tourist attractions that will ultimately boost the economy.For instance,Kate Midelton,Duchess of Cambridge Visited Pakistan  in year 2015,in an interview she stated that,she was contended to see the architecture built in USA is also present here in Pakistan which was made by their forefathers before independence,and still those buildings are intact and maintained by the government.\n\nOn the other hand Government officials should also spend funds on establishing new living spaces  for the accomodation of local people,and to meet the need of popullation additionally funds should be allocated for the making on new roads Consequently, inter-city travelling would become easier for local people.for instance,after heavy Moonsoon rainfall in Karachi,roads were completely damaged because of water blockage which resulted in the wash out of roads due to that inter-city travelling had

However, to reach that level, those countries have inflicted unrepairable damage to the environment to realise their rapid economic development. This has raised a debate among  experts about the benefits and drawbacks of economic growth to the global society. \r\n\r\nGovernments have always hoped that accelerated economic expansion could have solved poverty and hunger problems in their countries. Nevertheless, countless nations with rigorous economic power are still struggling to bring prosperity to their areas. This is because the majority of developed countries with massive economic power suffer from corruption in their governmental bodies. Consequently, although the nations are capable to distribute their wealth through tax and subsidies to end poverty and hunger, the capital is only flowing among the oligarchs of that countries.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the rise of sustainable economic development that considers not only the environment but also corporate and government acts of conduct seems to eliminate the drawbacks of economic growth. Moreover, implementing this concept could accelerate a nation ambition's to achieve net carbon zero without reducing its economic expansion rate. This is possible by integrating the economic concept with the core values of environment, sustainability, and governance. Additionally, the government could allocate their tax and subsidies more efficiently to reduce hunger and poverty in its area.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, the majority of countries achieve economic growth by inflicting damage on the surrounding environment to boost their productivity and end poverty and hunger. Nonetheless, developed countries with strong economic growth are still struggling to bring prosperity to their area. A new economic concept that considers the environment and sustainability allows the integration of both economic growth and conscious development. I believe that implementing sustainable economic growth might offer a solution that capable of eliminating hunger and poverty yet is safe for the environment.\n\nProvide your assessment in the specified JSON format."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"per_criterion\": [{\"name\": \"Task Response\", \"band\": 6.0, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"Economic powerhouse countries have always been known for low unemployment and poverty levels\", \"On the other hand, the rise of sustainable economic development that considers not only the environment but also corporate and government acts of conduct seems to eliminate the drawbacks of economic growth\", \"I believe that implementing sustainable economic growth might offer a solution that capable of eliminating hunger and poverty yet is safe for the environment\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"Economic powerhouse countries have always been known for low unemployment and poverty levels\", \"type\": \"task\", \"fix\": \"Consider improving the task response aspect here.\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Develop your main arguments more fully with specific examples.\", \"Ensure you address all parts of the question directly.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Coherence & Cohesion\", \"band\": 5.0, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"Economic powerhouse countries have always been known for low unemployment and poverty levels\", \"On the other hand, the rise of sustainable economic development that considers not only the environment but also corporate and government acts of conduct seems to eliminate the drawbacks of economic growth\", \"I believe that implementing sustainable economic growth might offer a solution that capable of eliminating hunger and poverty yet is safe for the environment\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"Economic powerhouse countries have always been known for low unemployment and poverty levels\", \"type\": \"coherence\", \"fix\": \"Consider improving the coherence & cohesion aspect here.\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Use more varied linking words to connect your ideas.\", \"Improve paragraph structure with clearer topic sentences.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Lexical Resource\", \"band\": 5.0, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"Economic powerhouse countries have always been known for low unemployment and poverty levels\", \"On the other hand, the rise of sustainable economic development that considers not only the environment but also corporate and government acts of conduct seems to eliminate the drawbacks of economic growth\", \"I believe that implementing sustainable economic growth might offer a solution that capable of eliminating hunger and poverty yet is safe for the environment\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"Economic powerhouse countries have always been known for low unemployment and poverty levels\", \"type\": \"lexical\", \"fix\": \"Consider improving the lexical resource aspect here.\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Use more sophisticated vocabulary and avoid repetition.\", \"Focus on precise word choice and natural collocations.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Grammatical Range & Accuracy\", \"band\": 6.0, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"Economic powerhouse countries have always been known for low unemployment and poverty levels\", \"On the other hand, the rise of sustainable economic development that considers not only the environment but also corporate and government acts of conduct seems to eliminate the drawbacks of economic growth\", \"I believe that implementing sustainable economic growth might offer a solution that capable of eliminating hunger and poverty yet is safe for the environment\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"Economic powerhouse countries have always been known for low unemployment and poverty levels\", \"type\": \"grammar\", \"fix\": \"Consider improving the grammatical range & accuracy aspect here.\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Use more complex sentence structures.\", \"Check for grammatical errors and improve accuracy.\"]}], \"overall\": 5.5, \"votes\": [5.5, 5.5, 5.5], \"dispersion\": 0.0, \"confidence\": \"high\", \"meta\": {\"prompt_hash\": \"training_data\", \"model\": \"training\", \"schema_version\": \"v1\", \"rubric_version\": \"rubric/v1\", \"token_usage\": {\"input_tokens\": 344, \"output_tokens\": 500}}}"}]}

It is thought that giving stringent punishments to offenders would reduce accidents. In my opinion, I completely agree with that thought, because people commit mistakes as they are taking things as granted.\r\n\r\nFirstly, most of the accidents are happening because of negligence while driving. Particulary, in the developing countries, people does not obey the traffic rules as there are not much strict punishments for disobeying driving rules. Unlike developed countries, where they have technologies in place to identify persons breaking the traffic laws. For example, many advanced economic countires have AI based camera at signals to capture photographs of cars that violates red signal and they would be punished at later point with the evidence captured. However, to implement these technologies in developing and under developing countires would be a huge problem as it inccur massive costs.\r\n\r\nSecondly, this is all about people mindset. For example, many countires have high degree of punishments for serious crimes and people will not dare to commit those crimes. Whereas, when it comes to driving offenses, it is not taken so seriously and also the penalty charges imposed are also very low. Hence, people will not take these laws very seriously. On the other hand, creating awareness by including traffic/driving laws in school subjects and campaign the effects of breaking laws would help but thats for the longer term as it would take time to see the results.\r\n\r\nFinally, in my opinion, relatively harsh punishments and more fines are required to bring down the driving offenses so that people take these laws more seriously and adopt it.

While I agree that schools can transform children into useful members of society, I believe that they also bring benefits to students themselves.\n\nOn the one hand, turning children into useful citizens is the main purpose of schools. The primary reason is that the same core subjects such as math, literature and civic education are present in the curriculum of most schools. Children, therefore, are expected to share the same moral standards, general knowledge and skills. If all members of society were to have such criteria, society would become more stable and civilized as the crime rate would be low. If schools were to fail to equip their students with needed skills or standards, they would not become productive members of society.  Thus, it is understandable why schools’ main responsibility is to producing good members of society.\n\nOn the other hand, it can argued that children themselves can reap of number of benefits. When children are taught a wide range of subjects, they can have the opportunity to become more well-rounded and widen their outlook on life. This would help them to be able to adapt to a new environment in their later life. Another benefit would be that schools are a perfect environment for students to develop their communication skill. This is largely because they are enabled to make friends with their classmates and talk to them virtually on a daily basis.

Besides this, feeling proud about their identity is an another possible reason.

As a result, they are proud of their national identities and its values.\r\n\r\nTo conclude, while there are valid arguments on both sides, I believe museums have an equally important role to serve as a leisure activity as well as for education, and people have sole right to decide upon what they want to do.\n\nProvide your assessment in the specified JSON format."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"per_criterion\": [{\"name\": \"Task Response\", \"band\": 6.5, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"The role of museums in our lives has been widely debated\", \"Conversely, these museums are the symbol of our cultural history, identity, and traditions\", \"To conclude, while there are valid arguments on both sides, I believe museums have an equally important role to serve as a leisure activity as well as for education, and people have sole right to decide upon what they want to do\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"The role of museums in our lives has been widely debated\", \"type\": \"task\", \"fix\": \"Consider improving the task response aspect here.\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Develop your main arguments more fully with specific examples.\", \"Ensure you address all parts of the question directly.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Coherence & Cohesion\", \"band\": 5.5, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"The role of museums in our lives has been widely debated\", \"Conversely, these museums are the symbol of our cultural history, identity, and traditions\", \"To conclude, while there are valid arguments on both sides, I believe museums have an equally important role to serve as a leisure activity as well as for education, and people have sole right to decide upon what they want to do\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"The role of museums in our lives has been widely debated\", \"type\": \"coherence\", \"fix\": \"Consider improving the coherence & cohesion aspect here.\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Use more varied linking words to connect your ideas.\", \"Improve paragraph structure with clearer topic sentences.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Lexical Resource\", \"band\": 5.5, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"The role of museums in our lives has been widely debated\", \"Conversely, these museums are the symbol of our cultural history, identity, and traditions\", \"To conclude, while there are valid arguments on both sides, I believe museums have an equally important role to serve as a leisure activity as well as for education, and people have sole right to decide upon what they want to do\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"The role of museums in our lives has been widely debated\", \"type\": \"lexical\", \"fix\": \"Consider improving the lexical resource aspect here.\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Use more sophisticated vocabulary and avoid repetition.\", \"Focus on precise word choice and natural collocations.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Grammatical Range & Accuracy\", \"band\": 6.5, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"The role of museums in our lives has been widely debated\", \"Conversely, these museums are the symbol of our cultural history, identity, and traditions\", \"To conclude, while there are valid arguments on both sides, I believe museums have an equally important role to serve as a leisure activity as well as for education, and people have sole right to decide upon what they want to do\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"The role of museums in our lives has been widely debated\", \"type\": \"grammar\", \"fix\": \"Consider improving the grammatical range & accuracy aspect here.\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Use more complex sentence structures.\", \"Check for grammatical errors and improve accuracy.\"]}], \"overall\": 6.0, \"votes\": [6.0, 6.0, 6.0], \"dispersion\": 0.0, \"confidence\": \"high\", \"meta\": {\"prompt_hash\": \"training_data\", \"model\": \"training\", \"schema_version\": \"v1\", \"rubric_version\": \"rubric/v1\", \"token_usage\": {\"input_tokens\": 304, \"output_tokens\": 500}}}"}]}

Also, prefer to do unpaid jobs when they are free from their work. This essay will discuss why I totally agree with the trend which has various benefits for both youngsters and the community.\r\n\r\nTo begin with, First of all, as  fresher most graduates do not have permanent jobs and after completing unpaid jobs, they will get not only references but also experience for their better career, therefore they can easily get their paid employment. Moreover, they can also get some certificates for their services and the opportunity to meet with persons who are working in senior posts in organizations. Thus, teenagers will have broader horizons.    \r\n\r\nMoreover, the same trend is also helpful to our humanity as well, because most  Trusts and NGOs do not have sufficient amount to complete their tasks for the welfare of  society.

From my point of view, I agree with this view and think that student will be more cooperate with each other when they play sport together. In the following paragraphs, the reasons to support my opinion will be outlined in detail.\r\n\r\nTo begin with, I strongly believe that sport can boost unity among the group of children for many reason. For the first reason, each player in team sports has their own specific duty in the game, therefore the result of a game will be depended on the abilities to organize players and teamwork. In the other word, if players in a team do not understand each other's skill or abandon some role in the team, such as goalkeeper in football, they will lose the game easily. As a result, children who play team sports have to be teamwork to defeat their opponent, and losing is an awesome way to teach them to cooperate.\r\n\r\nAnother reason is that there are many rules that can affect the game in the negative way if players do not have sportmanship, which teamwork is a part of it, and childrens will be taught to cooperate with thair team when they break the rule and be punished. In the other word, these rules are made for controlling players to have sportmanship and cooperate with their team, and players that do not have teamwork will be punished. Therefore, children who break the rule, such as getting red card in football and cannot participate the game until the end, will be acknowledged that they have to cooperate with team, and improve themselves in the next game. Therefore, team sport is the most effective way to teach children to cooperate with each other.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, playing team sports can cause players cooperate with their team, and this adventage can be use to teach children to cooperate with their friends in the school.

Due to technological development, people can easily access some healthy information about nutrition and physical activities. For example, some articles provide information about how to cook healthy food, making people conveniently follow and cook nutritional meals easier than in the past. Moreover, the Internet can provide information about the correct ways to do some physical activities which people can easily follow to do so.\r\n\r\nProviding functions for physical activities will increase and encourage people to follow this trend. To illustrate, the governments should invest in public parks and gyms which can help people to do more exercise by providing suitable equipment.

Additionally, campaigns about being healthy in society can encourage people to spend more time on exercise and eat some healthy food.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, technological development provides information about the health of people which encourages people to do more exercise and cook healthy food conveniently.

Although it is irrefutable that economic spring will do a disservice to the surroundings, I oppose this viewpoint since social concerns can be efficiently combatted.\r\n\r\nThere are several compelling rationales behind the environmentalists' fixation on halting the speed of economic expansion and urban sprawl. Certainly, earning a  lucrative revenue is an unattainable target without environmental sacrifices when multifunctional amenities and machinery are to be installed. By the negligence of other instrumental components, if governments only divert their budget to spur economic growth, nature's well-being will be left with a legacy of deterioration. For instance, instead of abating air pollution, Indian administrators have been inclined to prioritize the logistics leap, which undoubtedly comes at the expense of highly contaminated water sources for irrigation. Inevitably, the recurrence of dormant foodborne illnesses will not be ineradicable, overshadowing the redeeming features of a financial surge. \r\n\r\nOtherwise, there are underlying merits of highlighting the pivotal influence of monetary emphasis to address domestic issues. A multipronged approach, fostered by a stable economic status, is a must to dilute public implicit erosion from social upheaval. Consequently, a financial stronghold may fortify a country against potential turbulence, including either external invasion or internal decay. For example, in developed countries, such as the US and Canada, by triggering fast-paced commercial trade, successfully fulfilled the crevices of famine and averted escalating juvenile delinquency as a byproduct. Therefore, to hold a country from inner collapses and crises, the reinforcement in the commercial state is of paramount importance.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, reflecting the adverse impacts of industrialization on the environment by its insidious implications on the populace's health, governments should take steps to keep the issue at bay.

In this essay , I will discuss the major reasons behind this trend and explain whether it has more benefits or drawbacks.\r\n\r\nTo start with , the reasons why the masses do not like to have children at an early age . The first reason behind this seems to be saving money for their children and also trying to make themselves successful first . By , this I mean that if people only focus on making their future at a young age then they can save money for their future children for giving them a better life . Furthermore , this cannot happen when they have children in their 20s . The second reason appears to be the masses become more mature at a later age . In addition , people can make better decisions for their children because as per the reports , the divorce rate is quite low at the age after 30 . As a result , parents will bring up children with good qualities such as honesty , calmness and so on .\r\n\r\nOn the other hand , this trend has advantages as well as disadvantages for people . Firstly , the birth rate is too low at a later age so having children at an early age is a good choice. Secondly , the generation gap creates conflicts between parents and children which means it makes their relationship bad . For example , in a country like India , many old people go against love marriage , but young couples give permission for this because they can understand them more as compared to others.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion , the aforementioned points are the reasons why the masses do like to have children later .

In recent times, the trend of having children has increased significantly. This essay will discuss both the positive and negative outcomes of having children at older ages, while also explaining why the advantages tend to outweigh any perceived downsides .\r\n\r\nTo begin with, one of the main benefits is stability and maturity. Many individuals often lack sufficient time for their children at a young age due to career commitments and an unstable income. After having a great career, they can easily afford the best and the stable life for their child. According to a recent survey at Cambridge University, in developed countries, 80% of respondents plan to have children after the age of 35 years old. Furthermore, more mature parents tend to possess financial stability and independence. This stability can create an environment where children's needs are consistently met, improving their overall upbringing.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, it is essential to emphasize potential disadvantages. To commence with, complications during pregnancy can be increased by advanced maternal and paternal age, such as gestational diabetes, hypertension, and genetic disorders. In addition, older parents might have concerns about being able to provide for their children throughout their lives, especially if health issues arise later on.\r\n\r\n Also, the generation gap between older parents and their children might cause communication problems and difficulties in relating to each other’s experiences.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, despite several downsides, this trend should be welcomed and encouraged.

The advantages to this are that they get work experience and proper saving for, paying their tuition fees and it also brings some disadvantages too.\nOne of a positive side of taking a gap before continuing higher education is getting a valuable work experience by doing part-time or full-time employment. It is true that in many countries a candidate with no experience always struggles to get a good job after finishing tertiary education, whereas, a candidate who has a small experience before entering university often does not struggle to get a job in future. Another positive aspect is saving of some fund. This is because the higher education is so costly that most students do not continue their education, and with such savings not only do they continue their studies, but also do not have to depend on their parents or bank for a loan.\nThere are many negative sides to this but one of them is losing interest to continue the studies. For example, in China, 65% of students who took a gap of 6 months or a year never came back for their further education due to an interest in earning money. Another downside is that getting involved in bad activities. It has seen in many western countries that few students who travel or work for a certain period seem to get involved in bad influences such as, drugs, shoplifting or robbery.\nIn conclusion, even

As far as I am concerned, customers are very unlikely not to be influenced by constantly popping up advertisements.

To begin with, related laws should be enacted to regulate detrimental advertisements. It means the authorities should properly sensor advertisements, banning the advertisements that produce harmful content such as exaggeration or manipulation etc. Furthermore, more education should be given to the public to educate them on critical thinking so that they will have the ability to tell what is right from wrong. Doing so, it will also reduce the chance that buyers fall  victim due to their lack of knowledge. \n\nIn conclusion, the increasing advertisements have definitely made their way to significantly impact customers in their lives.

In my opinion, I firmly disagree with this argument as it has the potential to disrupt world economy and global peace severely.\nTo begin with, transportation, industrial production, and even energy generation sectors run their operations on oil. If the oil prices are increased, it raises the prices of the products and services of these sectors as well. As a result, this affects the general public’s ability to afford basic products and services which is known as inflation. This does not only affects the households but also slows down the overall growth of the economy. For instance, in developing countries, it is often observed that whenever the petrol price jumps up, the economic growth jumps down.     \nMoreover, increasing the fuel cost not just disturbs the economy, it can promote instability as well.

This because many people flock from different nations to attend these competitions, therefore, revenues can be increased because of tourism.

Some people consider that robots are vital to the human future development, whereas others think machines bring negative influence on the society. In my opinion, I believe that robots are essential for people’s planned development, while they have negative impacts in some way.\r\nTechnology developments, in other words, robots, they have important to our subsequent. Robots can do any kind of manufacturing task if scientists build and code them. Moreover, machines produce more efficient job in a short period of time, so they save time and it is good for company’s economy. To illustrate, over 60 percent of industry done by robots in Japanese renowned car company Toyota.\r\nOther people, however, think that machines are not safe and can lead to negative effects on the social fabric. If there are too many robots work in manufacturing or other job action, there will be shortage of job for human. Furthermore, another drawback of dominating robots is they could be developed high and want to control human beings. \r\nIn my opinion, robots have a vital involvement to our subsequent development for the reason that robots could do jobs that people cannot. Take one example, robots are important for scientific research such as outer space research, they can work without air and water. Thus, only people need to control them in an optimal level. \r\nIn conclusion, developing future depends on either human and robots.

In my opinion, however, the speculation is not completely true. Although the major laborious work shall be done by robots, the jobs where human intelligence and human skills are required can never be replaced by machines. This essay will discuss why not all jobs can be done with artificial intelligence.\nAlthough, many companies are going to make systems automated, and buying most efficient and smart machines to get the jobs done to eradicate human errors. In England, for example, almost all security guards have been replaced by hi-tech security systems. Moreover, almost in all over the world, conventional banking systems have been upgraded and ATMs have been installed for cash deposit and withdrawal, the major benefit of ATMs is that they serve their purpose twenty-four hours, seven days a week without breaks. Therefore, due to the clear advantages of artificial intelligence and foreseeable accuracy and efficiency, many jobs will be taken by machines from humans in the future. \nAs per my speculations, a variety of jobs will still be done by humans only, because it is impossible to completely vanish humans to develop the world. Jobs like teaching, research work, engineering, and architectural planning are just a few examples of jobs which cannot be performed by machines. For instance, the machines work on predefined algorithms installed in it, therefore, a machine can never perform a task which is not defined in its algorithm. This limitation simply indicates that a robot is made to perform a certain task and cannot play smartly if needed to perform some out of the scope job.\nAt last, although many of the jobs where not much pondering is required will be done by robots. This will be economical for companies, and humans will be safe to do physically hard work.

In my opinion, I partly agree with this argument, while increasing the cost of fuel may reduce the amount of emissions, however, it could affect the rate of industrializing and modernizing that I will discuss in-depth in this essay.\r\n\r\nIt is true that rising the cost of fuel can alleviate the consumption of them for transportation propose. Emissions emitted from cars could be seen as the major reason for global warming and other environmental problems. In fact, there are more people who want to own private vehicles to transfer easier. Thus, more useless emissions could be exhausted into the air which leads to a rise in the rate of pollution in many areas. Heightening the cost of this fuel, including increasing taxes on trading fuel could be a feasible solution to deal with environmental problems occurred in this day and age.\r\n\r\nHowever, increasing the fee for fuel could lengthen the period of industrialization and modernization, which affect directly to the development of our society. The use of cars and other vehicles is one of the major standards to judge whether a society is over the line of poverty or not. For example, to separate a country into groups of developing or developed countries, the rate of owning cars could be a crucial figure to judge. Moreover, a rise in the rate of using cars could grow the number of car products and car brands could gain more profit, which affects to development of the car industry.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, while rising the cost of vehicles' fuel is a recommended solution to solve environmental problems, however, it could slow down the process of industrialization and modernization.

To what extent do you agree or disagree?\n\nScore this IELTS Task 2 essay according to the rubric, ensuring alignment with the question:\n\nGiven the ongoing poverty in underdeveloped countries, a multitude of individuals maintain that the most optimal solution is to provide children with  a 6-year education free of charge to eradicate illiteracy and improve numeracy. I find myself largely in agreement with this proposition as free education can equip them with foundational skills and liberate their mindset; however, it is essential to incorporate other solutions to form a comprehensive plan.\r\n\r\nThe foremost rationale for my endorsement of free-of-charge early education as the best solution is that it provides all children in developing countries, regardless of their family background, fundamental academic skills which include the ability to read, write and perform basic maths. These foundational skills would form a concrete basis for these children to thrive in the pursuit of knowledge, acquiring desirable degrees which vastly increase the chances of paid employment and a stable income in the future.\r\n\r\nThe second argument for why I support prioritising sponsoring tuition fees being the key to addressing poverty is the fact that school lessons allow children to escape from orthodox traditions. In the mountainous regions of Vietnam, these outdated traditions encompass early marriage, child labour and heavy drinking which are the underlying causes of underdevelopment. If all children were sent to free schools, they would be taught a more modern mindset, which celebrates liberation and personal growth, becoming independent individuals who can find their own way out of impoverishment.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, I acknowledge the importance of other approaches in an effort to support impoverished people. For instance, financial organisations should provide funding for upgrading infrastructure with better-connected roads and bridges. These would not only foster economic growth but also cultural exchanges that enable sustainable development.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, I mostly agree with the idea of offering 6 years of schooling free of charge with a view to ending poverty in developing nations as it makes it possible for young people to acquire basic knowledge and have a more liberal mindset even though additional initiatives such as infrastructure improvement should also be in place. That is why governments should develop a comprehensive plan to address the issue of poverty systematically.\n\nProvide your assessment in the specified JSON format."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"per_criterion\": [{\"name\": \"Task Response\", \"band\": 7.5, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"Given the ongoing poverty in underdeveloped countries, a multitude of individuals maintain that the most optimal solution is to provide children with  a 6-year education free of charge to eradicate illiteracy and improve numeracy\", \"If all children were sent to free schools, they would be taught a more modern mindset, which celebrates liberation and personal growth, becoming independent individuals who can find their own way out of impoverishment\", \"That is why governments should develop a comprehensive plan to address the issue of poverty systematically\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"Given the ongoing poverty in underdeveloped countries, a multitude of individuals maintain that the \", \"type\": \"task\", \"fix\": \"Consider improving the task response aspect here.\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Develop your main arguments more fully with specific examples.\", \"Ensure you address all parts of the question directly.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Coherence & Cohesion\", \"band\": 6.5, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"Given the ongoing poverty in underdeveloped countries, a multitude of individuals maintain that the most optimal solution is to provide children with  a 6-year education free of charge to eradicate illiteracy and improve numeracy\", \"If all children were sent to free schools, they would be taught a more modern mindset, which celebrates liberation and personal growth, becoming independent individuals who can find their own way out of impoverishment\", \"That is why governments should develop a comprehensive plan to address the issue of poverty systematically\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"Given the ongoing poverty in underdeveloped countries, a multitude of individuals maintain that the \", \"type\": \"coherence\", \"fix\": \"Consider improving the coherence & cohesion aspect here.\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Use more varied linking words to connect your ideas.\", \"Improve paragraph structure with clearer topic sentences.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Lexical Resource\", \"band\": 6.5, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"Given the ongoing poverty in underdeveloped countries, a multitude of individuals maintain that the most optimal solution is to provide children with  a 6-year education free of charge to eradicate illiteracy and improve numeracy\", \"If all children were sent to free schools, they would be taught a more modern mindset, which celebrates liberation and personal growth, becoming independent individuals who can find their own way out of impoverishment\", \"That is why governments should develop a comprehensive plan to address the issue of poverty systematically\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"Given the ongoing poverty in underdeveloped countries, a multitude of individuals maintain that the \", \"type\": \"lexical\", \"fix\": \"Consider improving the lexical resource aspect here.\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Use more sophisticated vocabulary and avoid repetition.\", \"Focus on precise word choice and natural collocations.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Grammatical Range & Accuracy\", \"band\": 7.5, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"Given the ongoing poverty in underdeveloped countries, a multitude of individuals maintain that the most optimal solution is to provide children with  a 6-year education free of charge to eradicate illiteracy and improve numeracy\", \"If all children were sent to free schools, they would be taught a more modern mindset, which celebrates liberation and personal growth, becoming independent individuals who can find their own way out of impoverishment\", \"That is why governments should develop a comprehensive plan to address the issue of poverty systematically\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"Given the ongoing poverty in underdeveloped countries, a multitude of individuals maintain that the \", \"type\": \"grammar\", \"fix\": \"Consider improving the grammatical range & accuracy aspect here.\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Use more complex sentence structures.\", \"Check for grammatical errors and improve accuracy.\"]}], \"overall\": 7.0, \"votes\": [7.0, 7.0, 7.0], \"dispersion\": 0.0, \"confidence\": \"high\", \"meta\": {\"prompt_hash\": \"training_data\", \"model\": \"training\", \"schema_version\": \"v1\", \"rubric_version\": \"rubric/v1\", \"token_usage\": {\"input_tokens\": 391, \"output_tokens\": 500}}}"}]}

Firstly, academic qualifications are required in the majority of professions. For example, it is impossible to become a doctor, teacher or lawyer without having a degree. As a result, nowadays a large number of industries and hospitals are only hiring people who have a bachelor degree or higher. Secondly, in recent years, the job market is becoming more competitive and sometimes there are hundred of applicants for one position in a company.

Do you think this has more advantages than disadvantages?\n\nScore this IELTS Task 2 essay according to the rubric, ensuring alignment with the question:\n\nIn today’s modern society, various new employment opportunities make the younger generation change their occupations every few years. Although changing jobs has a certain merit, I am firmly convinced that its demerits are more significant.\r\n\r\nOn the one hand, a major benefit when people change their occupations several times is that they can have more experience with many kinds of jobs. This is mainly because during the same time, if they have different jobs, they can obtain more working experiences and skills. Thus, they can discover their potential and passion more easily. For instance, Jenn Im, who is a famous youtuber, had tried many jobs such as writing or teaching before becoming a beauty blogger. Therefore, changing jobs often may bring experiences that staying in one job cannot provide.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, it is my firm belief that there are some drawbacks that cannot be neglected. The first significant drawback is that people do not have enough time to have profound experience. In today’s world of work, a fundamental condition which applies to many positions in a company requires a minimum of 2 or 3 years of experience in the professional field.

Moreover, they think there are more vital and immediate issues that need more attention and investment than nature catastrophies, since they have not seen any servere effects yet.

This is because, according to some professors and researchers that are specialised in the weather, they said that changing of the climate is an issue that is being built up overtime so it needs to be handle as soon as possible. For example, sea level rising in many Europeans coutries or costal cities is a major problems, since for the next 30 to 50 years, if we cannot construct enough dams or finding the practical solutions to control the global temperature, they these whole area will drown, which can lead to many serious consequent effects.\n\nIn conclusion, people might say that we just need to find a way to live with the problem, but I believe that the sooner we deal with this change, the better the outcome.\n\nProvide your assessment in the specified JSON format."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"per_criterion\": [{\"name\": \"Task Response\", \"band\": 7.0, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"Nowadays, there is no doubt that people are becoming more aware of global warming and its consequences\", \"Let's not forget that, for the last two months, many Americans, especially people who lived in Texas suffered from snowfalls, which has never happened before so many residents lost their home, because they never experienced such events so theyr house cannot withstand the harsh conditions\", \"In conclusion, people might say that we just need to find a way to live with the problem, but I believe that the sooner we deal with this change, the better the outcome\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"Nowadays, there is no doubt that people are becoming more aware of global warming and its consequenc\", \"type\": \"task\", \"fix\": \"Consider improving the task response aspect here.\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Develop your main arguments more fully with specific examples.\", \"Ensure you address all parts of the question directly.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Coherence & Cohesion\", \"band\": 6.0, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"Nowadays, there is no doubt that people are becoming more aware of global warming and its consequences\", \"Let's not forget that, for the last two months, many Americans, especially people who lived in Texas suffered from snowfalls, which has never happened before so many residents lost their home, because they never experienced such events so theyr house cannot withstand the harsh conditions\", \"In conclusion, people might say that we just need to find a way to live with the problem, but I believe that the sooner we deal with this change, the better the outcome\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"Nowadays, there is no doubt that people are becoming more aware of global warming and its consequenc\", \"type\": \"coherence\", \"fix\": \"Consider improving the coherence & cohesion aspect here.\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Use more varied linking words to connect your ideas.\", \"Improve paragraph structure with clearer topic sentences.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Lexical Resource\", \"band\": 6.0, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"Nowadays, there is no doubt that people are becoming more aware of global warming and its consequences\", \"Let's not forget that, for the last two months, many Americans, especially people who lived in Texas suffered from snowfalls, which has never happened before so many residents lost their home, because they never experienced such events so theyr house cannot withstand the harsh conditions\", \"In conclusion, people might say that we just need to find a way to live with the problem, but I believe that the sooner we deal with this change, the better the outcome\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"Nowadays, there is no doubt that people are becoming more aware of global warming and its consequenc\", \"type\": \"lexical\", \"fix\": \"Consider improving the lexical resource aspect here.\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Use more sophisticated vocabulary and avoid repetition.\", \"Focus on precise word choice and natural collocations.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Grammatical Range & Accuracy\", \"band\": 7.0, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"Nowadays, there is no doubt that people are becoming more aware of global warming and its consequences\", \"Let's not forget that, for the last two months, many Americans, especially people who lived in Texas suffered from snowfalls, which has never happened before so many residents lost their home, because they never experienced such events so theyr house cannot withstand the harsh conditions\", \"In conclusion, people might say that we just need to find a way to live with the problem, but I believe that the sooner we deal with this change, the better the outcome\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"Nowadays, there is no doubt that people are becoming more aware of global warming and its consequenc\", \"type\": \"grammar\", \"fix\": \"Consider improving the grammatical range & accuracy aspect here.\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Use more complex sentence structures.\", \"Check for grammatical errors and improve accuracy.\"]}], \"overall\": 6.5, \"votes\": [6.5, 6.5, 6.5], \"dispersion\": 0.0, \"confidence\": \"high\", \"meta\": {\"prompt_hash\": \"training_data\", \"model\": \"training\", \"schema_version\": \"v1\", \"rubric_version\": \"rubric/v1\", \"token_usage\": {\"input_tokens\": 391, \"output_tokens\": 500}}}"}]}

I totally agree with that opinion as there are a lot of young teen who consume their time for unhealthy activities. This essay will discuss why teenagers must join with community tasks.\r\n\r\nTo begin with, teenagers have good health and sharp minds to help their communities. To make it clear, this means the age of 15 to 22 years old is regarded as puberty with well-being and creativity. They can learn fast and use their power to assist others. For example, a young teen might spend their hours after school to go to a nursing home or hospital and support the staff to run errands. Clearly, the youngster is stronger and smarter than other ages, therefore they should give a hand to teen  who are living around them. \r\n\r\nAdditionally, these growing teen are developing their life skills, thus, it is crucial to volunteer and correct their demerits. Nowadays, there are a bunch of teenagers who prefer spending their leisure time on computer and smartphone without interacting with other teen. This shapes their personalities and cognition to be slow and dependable. However, if they go outside and collaborate with others, they definitely pick up on a variety of useful lessons. For instance, a youngster who would like to volunteer for daycare, she probably can gain some skills of taking care of kids and others. Thus, volunteering benefits each individual if they aspire to perfect their moralities. \r\n\r\nIn conclusion, contributing effort for the community brings many advantages for young teen, and helps them to establish their goals in the future.\n\nProvide your assessment in the specified JSON format."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"per_criterion\": [{\"name\": \"Task Response\", \"band\": 6.0, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"Some ideas exist that youngsters could contribute their spare time to work volunteering for society\", \"Clearly, the youngster is stronger and smarter than other ages, therefore they should give a hand to teen  who are living around them\", \"In conclusion, contributing effort for the community brings many advantages for young teen, and helps them to establish their goals in the future\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"Some ideas exist that youngsters could contribute their spare time to work volunteering for society\", \"type\": \"task\", \"fix\": \"Consider improving the task response aspect here.\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Develop your main arguments more fully with specific examples.\", \"Ensure you address all parts of the question directly.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Coherence & Cohesion\", \"band\": 5.0, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"Some ideas exist that youngsters could contribute their spare time to work volunteering for society\", \"Clearly, the youngster is stronger and smarter than other ages, therefore they should give a hand to teen  who are living around them\", \"In conclusion, contributing effort for the community brings many advantages for young teen, and helps them to establish their goals in the future\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"Some ideas exist that youngsters could contribute their spare time to work volunteering for society\", \"type\": \"coherence\", \"fix\": \"Consider improving the coherence & cohesion aspect here.\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Use more varied linking words to connect your ideas.\", \"Improve paragraph structure with clearer topic sentences.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Lexical Resource\", \"band\": 5.0, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"Some ideas exist that youngsters could contribute their spare time to work volunteering for society\", \"Clearly, the youngster is stronger and smarter than other ages, therefore they should give a hand to teen  who are living around them\", \"In conclusion, contributing effort for the community brings many advantages for young teen, and helps them to establish their goals in the future\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"Some ideas exist that youngsters could contribute their spare time to work volunteering for society\", \"type\": \"lexical\", \"fix\": \"Consider improving the lexical resource aspect here.\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Use more sophisticated vocabulary and avoid repetition.\", \"Focus on precise word choice and natural collocations.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Grammatical Range & Accuracy\", \"band\": 6.0, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"Some ideas exist that youngsters could contribute their spare time to work volunteering for society\", \"Clearly, the youngster is stronger and smarter than other ages, therefore they should give a hand to teen  who are living around them\", \"In conclusion, contributing effort for the community brings many advantages for young teen, and helps them to establish their goals in the future\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"Some ideas exist that youngsters could contribute their spare time to work volunteering for society\", \"type\": \"grammar\", \"fix\": \"Consider improving the grammatical range & accuracy aspect here.\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Use more complex sentence structures.\", \"Check for grammatical errors and improve accuracy.\"]}], \"overall\": 5.5, \"votes\": [5.5, 5.5, 5.5], \"dispersion\": 0.0, \"confidence\": \"high\", \"meta\": {\"prompt_hash\": \"training_data\", \"model\": \"training\", \"schema_version\": \"v1\", \"rubric_version\": \"rubric/v1\", \"token_usage\": {\"input_tokens\": 307, \"output_tokens\": 500}}}"}]}

Personall, i disagree with this statement because it has more than one to make safely on the road.\n\nOne of the reamarkable that people should know that the accidents don't just only from offerces of riding, it also depends on the other factors. In particular, weather condition contributed significantly to have negative imfact while the transport facilities also caused many terrible accidents. For example, it is difficult to take part in the traffic of the place, such as Sapa where fog covers everyday and the road is around the mountain, because of the complex movement, specially in the rain day. In addition, there are more and more vehicles in the world and the road isn't still expanded, so a huge number of traffic jam become common and consllitions between transport is more. Therefor, to improve road safely, people should pay more attention to find out the reasons what make the roas isn't safe.\n\nThe main reason that can make more accidents is from aware and responsibilities of each other people. In specific, if the governments are able to ban the policies or manage stricly with the unlaw actions of driving, but the citizens don't follow these, the figures of consllitions of traffic still rise. Futhermore, from people's aware, accommulating the knowledge on traffic is necessary in the modern world because they need to know about the laws and carry out these to save themselve and develop their country. For instance, people when join in the traffic don't break the law means that the number of polices also recline and governments can focus on developing their country with the best way. \n\nIn conclusion, for these reasons i have mention above i think that, it is more and more ways to keep the safe on the road with the right actions of the government and individual, in the future, the accident or consllitions will fall suddenly.\n\nProvide your assessment in the specified JSON format."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"per_criterion\": [{\"name\": \"Task Response\", \"band\": 6.0, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"Some people think that the driving crimes should be managed strictly is the only solution to keep the safe on the road and reduce the accidents\", \"Therefor, to improve road safely, people should pay more attention to find out the reasons what make the roas isn't safe\", \"In conclusion, for these reasons i have mention above i think that, it is more and more ways to keep the safe on the road with the right actions of the government and individual, in the future, the accident or consllitions will fall suddenly\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"Some people think that the driving crimes should be managed strictly is the only solution to keep th\", \"type\": \"task\", \"fix\": \"Consider improving the task response aspect here.\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Develop your main arguments more fully with specific examples.\", \"Ensure you address all parts of the question directly.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Coherence & Cohesion\", \"band\": 5.0, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"Some people think that the driving crimes should be managed strictly is the only solution to keep the safe on the road and reduce the accidents\", \"Therefor, to improve road safely, people should pay more attention to find out the reasons what make the roas isn't safe\", \"In conclusion, for these reasons i have mention above i think that, it is more and more ways to keep the safe on the road with the right actions of the government and individual, in the future, the accident or consllitions will fall suddenly\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"Some people think that the driving crimes should be managed strictly is the only solution to keep th\", \"type\": \"coherence\", \"fix\": \"Consider improving the coherence & cohesion aspect here.\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Use more varied linking words to connect your ideas.\", \"Improve paragraph structure with clearer topic sentences.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Lexical Resource\", \"band\": 5.0, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"Some people think that the driving crimes should be managed strictly is the only solution to keep the safe on the road and reduce the accidents\", \"Therefor, to improve road safely, people should pay more attention to find out the reasons what make the roas isn't safe\", \"In conclusion, for these reasons i have mention above i think that, it is more and more ways to keep the safe on the road with the right actions of the government and individual, in the future, the accident or consllitions will fall suddenly\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"Some people think that the driving crimes should be managed strictly is the only solution to keep th\", \"type\": \"lexical\", \"fix\": \"Consider improving the lexical resource aspect here.\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Use more sophisticated vocabulary and avoid repetition.\", \"Focus on precise word choice and natural collocations.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Grammatical Range & Accuracy\", \"band\": 6.0, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"Some people think that the driving crimes should be managed strictly is the only solution to keep the safe on the road and reduce the accidents\", \"Therefor, to improve road safely, people should pay more attention to find out the reasons what make the roas isn't safe\", \"In conclusion, for these reasons i have mention above i think that, it is more and more ways to keep the safe on the road with the right actions of the government and individual, in the future, the accident or consllitions will fall suddenly\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"Some people think that the driving crimes should be managed strictly is the only solution to keep th\", \"type\": \"grammar\", \"fix\": \"Consider improving the grammatical range & accuracy aspect here.\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Use more complex sentence structures.\", \"Check for grammatical errors and improve accuracy.\"]}], \"overall\": 5.5, \"votes\": [5.5, 5.5, 5.5], \"dispersion\": 0.0, \"confidence\": \"high\", \"meta\": {\"prompt_hash\": \"training_data\", \"model\": \"training\", \"schema_version\": \"v1\", \"rubric_version\": \"rubric/v1\", \"token_usage\": {\"input_tokens\": 365, \"output_tokens\": 500}}}"}]}

To what extent do you agree or disagree?\n\nScore this IELTS Task 2 essay according to the rubric, ensuring alignment with the question:\n\nIt is often argued that in order to decrease the level of environmental contamination the most effective solution is to uprise the costs for oil and gas. I consider such an option as iгтзкщьшыштп and useless.  \r\n\r\nFirst of all the rising costs for fuels for machines do not solve the problem with pollution since the same amount of fuels will still be required for the development of the economy and feeding growing populations of the planet. It means that it potentially just boosts the rate of inflation and the value of currencies would drop in every country without any positive impact on the environment. It will occur due to the ratio between the demand for goods and products and resources that are being used for their manufacturing, including gasoline. For example, agriculture will still require fuel for processing harvests from sowing to gathering.  \r\n\r\nThe other point is that we need to reduce not the expenditures for oil and gas but finding new sources of alternative energy to be used instead of fuels such as electrical batteries for cars or wind stations that do not emit green gases. This follows from the understanding that further development cannot be reached without forms of powers that move cars and other types of machines. For example, the expansion of electric cars can replace the cars, using petrol and as a result, we would have less contamination rate and the absence of necessity to increase costs  for fuels, which, by the way,  would be even lower due to the lack of demand. \r\n\r\nIn conclusion, although most proponents insist on increasing fuel costs, I believe that such a solution looks like masking the problem but not resolving it, since the economy would require the same amount of energy  for development.

Firstly, it reduces physical distance among individuals. Nowadays pupil leave their towns for higher education or to get jobs so this help them to keep in touch with them.

Thirdly, news channels also use the electronic media to relay daily news. Audience use it as an opportunity to keep themselves updated with various events. For example, Facebook is one the platfrom where one can find old friends and subordinates. Furthermore, they are even able to find products for themselves and apart from it, they are constantly getting knowledge about various activities going around the world.\r\n\r\nIn contrast, there are few negative aspects as well. Hackers community use the personal information provided by a profile holder to perform some unethical actions. Not only they create a dumy profile by same name but also ask for money from some friends.  Another, con linked with electronic media is authencity of data. Neferious elements spread fake news to distrub harmony and peace . For instance, on social messangers photoshoped images are shared which hurts sentiments of the targeted person and it creates rucks in the society.\r\n\r\nTo conclude with, it can be uderstand that inspite of few disadvantages, there are increased number of advantages which outshines the former.\n\nProvide your assessment in the specified JSON format."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"per_criterion\": [{\"name\": \"Task Response\", \"band\": 6.0, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"In recent days, social media has become one of the important platform to get news at glance and remain connected with friends and peers\", \"Audience use it as an opportunity to keep themselves updated with various events\", \"To conclude with, it can be uderstand that inspite of few disadvantages, there are increased number of advantages which outshines the former\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"In recent days, social media has become one of the important platform to get news at glance and rema\", \"type\": \"task\", \"fix\": \"Consider improving the task response aspect here.\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Develop your main arguments more fully with specific examples.\", \"Ensure you address all parts of the question directly.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Coherence & Cohesion\", \"band\": 5.0, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"In recent days, social media has become one of the important platform to get news at glance and remain connected with friends and peers\", \"Audience use it as an opportunity to keep themselves updated with various events\", \"To conclude with, it can be uderstand that inspite of few disadvantages, there are increased number of advantages which outshines the former\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"In recent days, social media has become one of the important platform to get news at glance and rema\", \"type\": \"coherence\", \"fix\": \"Consider improving the coherence & cohesion aspect here.\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Use more varied linking words to connect your ideas.\", \"Improve paragraph structure with clearer topic sentences.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Lexical Resource\", \"band\": 5.0, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"In recent days, social media has become one of the important platform to get news at glance and remain connected with friends and peers\", \"Audience use it as an opportunity to keep themselves updated with various events\", \"To conclude with, it can be uderstand that inspite of few disadvantages, there are increased number of advantages which outshines the former\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"In recent days, social media has become one of the important platform to get news at glance and rema\", \"type\": \"lexical\", \"fix\": \"Consider improving the lexical resource aspect here.\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Use more sophisticated vocabulary and avoid repetition.\", \"Focus on precise word choice and natural collocations.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Grammatical Range & Accuracy\", \"band\": 6.0, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"In recent days, social media has become one of the important platform to get news at glance and remain connected with friends and peers\", \"Audience use it as an opportunity to keep themselves updated with various events\", \"To conclude with, it can be uderstand that inspite of few disadvantages, there are increased number of advantages which outshines the former\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"In recent days, social media has become one of the important platform to get news at glance and rema\", \"type\": \"grammar\", \"fix\": \"Consider improving the grammatical range & accuracy aspect here.\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Use more complex sentence structures.\", \"Check for grammatical errors and improve accuracy.\"]}], \"overall\": 5.5, \"votes\": [5.5, 5.5, 5.5], \"dispersion\": 0.0, \"confidence\": \"high\", \"meta\": {\"prompt_hash\": \"training_data\", \"model\": \"training\", \"schema_version\": \"v1\", \"rubric_version\": \"rubric/v1\", \"token_usage\": {\"input_tokens\": 319, \"output_tokens\": 500}}}"}]}

To what extent do you agree or disagree?\n\nScore this IELTS Task 2 essay according to the rubric, ensuring alignment with the question:\n\nRecently, the extent of the environmental problems we are facing has become so vast, that major policy changes are required on a global level. Several people believe that one of the most feasible solutions to these problems, is to increase fuel prices for vehicles. I personally disagree with this idea, and in this essay, I will elaborate on the possible hindrances that it could cause to the general population of a country. \nEffluents released by the combustion of fuel in automobiles is definitely one of the leading causes of air pollution. Often, the degree of damage done to the environment is so extensive, that it is either difficult or impossible to breathe with ease. This is especially true in large cities having a high population density, where innumerable vehicles hit the roads on a daily basis. However, increasing fuel prices would definitely not aid in solving the problem at hand in a way that benefits the public, especially in developing or underdeveloped countries. For example, in a developing country like India, the average per capita income is far below the poverty line. In this case, increasing petrol and diesel rates would make the commodity entirely inaccessible to the common man. Furthermore, this would lead to an increase in fares in public transport, thereby discouraging the public from using the service. An overall hike would be seen in the price of goods, due to the increase in their transportation costs, and low-income houses would face serious difficulties to make ends meet. \nSecondly, let us look at the adversities faced by countries where the constant rise of petrol prices is a pressing issue, by considering India as an example. The inflation of oil prices was a major cause of public outrage, as citizens claimed that the tax being placed on the product was excessive, while the government claimed it was essential. Hence, it is clear that though increasing gas prices seems like an airtight solution on paper, it would inevitably cause numerous difficulties in the lives of the public. Therefore, we must first consider educating people on the processes of car-pooling and the benefits it could have to both the environment, as well as their savings. Another possible answer could be the odd/even method, wherein citizens must alternate between using private transport and public facilities. \nIn conclusion, even though this method might bring about the desired result, it would give rise to several other issues. Therefore, I strongly believe that while the proposed solution might seem obvious, it is not possible to implement this on a global scale without putting the middle and lower classes under serious strain. \n\n\nProvide your assessment in the specified JSON format."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"per_criterion\": [{\"name\": \"Task Response\", \"band\": 8.0, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"Recently, the extent of the environmental problems we are facing has become so vast, that major policy changes are required on a global level\", \"Furthermore, this would lead to an increase in fares in public transport, thereby discouraging the public from using the service\", \"Therefore, I strongly believe that while the proposed solution might seem obvious, it is not possible to implement this on a global scale without putting the middle and lower classes under serious strain\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"Recently, the extent of the environmental problems we are facing has become so vast, that major poli\", \"type\": \"task\", \"fix\": \"Consider improving the task response aspect here.\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Develop your main arguments more fully with specific examples.\", \"Ensure you address all parts of the question directly.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Coherence & Cohesion\", \"band\": 7.0, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"Recently, the extent of the environmental problems we are facing has become so vast, that major policy changes are required on a global level\", \"Furthermore, this would lead to an increase in fares in public transport, thereby discouraging the public from using the service\", \"Therefore, I strongly believe that while the proposed solution might seem obvious, it is not possible to implement this on a global scale without putting the middle and lower classes under serious strain\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"Recently, the extent of the environmental problems we are facing has become so vast, that major poli\", \"type\": \"coherence\", \"fix\": \"Consider improving the coherence & cohesion aspect here.\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Use more varied linking words to connect your ideas.\", \"Improve paragraph structure with clearer topic sentences.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Lexical Resource\", \"band\": 7.0, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"Recently, the extent of the environmental problems we are facing has become so vast, that major policy changes are required on a global level\", \"Furthermore, this would lead to an increase in fares in public transport, thereby discouraging the public from using the service\", \"Therefore, I strongly believe that while the proposed solution might seem obvious, it is not possible to implement this on a global scale without putting the middle and lower classes under serious strain\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"Recently, the extent of the environmental problems we are facing has become so vast, that major poli\", \"type\": \"lexical\", \"fix\": \"Consider improving the lexical resource aspect here.\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Use more sophisticated vocabulary and avoid repetition.\", \"Focus on precise word choice and natural collocations.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Grammatical Range & Accuracy\", \"band\": 8.0, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"Recently, the extent of the environmental problems we are facing has become so vast, that major policy changes are required on a global level\", \"Furthermore, this would lead to an increase in fares in public transport, thereby discouraging the public from using the service\", \"Therefore, I strongly believe that while the proposed solution might seem obvious, it is not possible to implement this on a global scale without putting the middle and lower classes under serious strain\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"Recently, the extent of the environmental problems we are facing has become so vast, that major poli\", \"type\": \"grammar\", \"fix\": \"Consider improving the grammatical range & accuracy aspect here.\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Use more complex sentence structures.\", \"Check for grammatical errors and improve accuracy.\"]}], \"overall\": 7.5, \"votes\": [7.5, 7.5, 7.5], \"dispersion\": 0.0, \"confidence\": \"high\", \"meta\": {\"prompt_hash\": \"training_data\", \"model\": \"training\", \"schema_version\": \"v1\", \"rubric_version\": \"rubric/v1\", \"token_usage\": {\"input_tokens\": 469, \"output_tokens\": 500}}}"}]}

However, there is a tendency to believe that guided learning and other conventional traits of education can be faded away by 2050. I truly believe that the teaching system will be light years ahead of what we have at present moment due to the technological breakthrough and drawbacks of teacher-led lessons. \r\n\r\nFirstly, robots may provide insightful knowledge and assess students’ performance instead of human teachers. Recent technological innovations demonstrate that human labor can be replaced by machines as well as robots are able to perform the same work at the same level. The modern educational system is not the exception for that. Internet is already full of reliable sources, which could be used by students independently. For instance, some schools and esteemed universities such as Cambridge practice autonomous learning via laptops with guidelines. \r\n\r\nSecondly, plenty of situations related to teacher-student relationships shows that there are alarming drawbacks associated with this type of teaching and learning. The human factor leads to some educators having biased attitude towards different students. Thus, unfair evaluation can very likely discourage students from taking part in the subject, thereby they lose natural inquisitiveness. The education authorities are already concerned with this issue, therefore the tradition of teacher-led studying can be replaced by something else in further future. \r\n\r\nTo conclude, I suspect that though studying process is tightly related to guided learning, technological development and detrimental sides of providing information through human will change the perspective of educating systems. \r\n\r\n260 words\n\nProvide your assessment in the specified JSON format."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"per_criterion\": [{\"name\": \"Task Response\", \"band\": 5.5, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"The traditional educational process typically assumes that students are learning under supervision of a teacher in a classroom\", \"Internet is already full of reliable sources, which could be used by students independently\", \"To conclude, I suspect that though studying process is tightly related to guided learning, technological development and detrimental sides of providing information through human will change the perspective of educating systems\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"The traditional educational process typically assumes that students are learning under supervision o\", \"type\": \"task\", \"fix\": \"Consider improving the task response aspect here.\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Develop your main arguments more fully with specific examples.\", \"Ensure you address all parts of the question directly.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Coherence & Cohesion\", \"band\": 4.5, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"The traditional educational process typically assumes that students are learning under supervision of a teacher in a classroom\", \"Internet is already full of reliable sources, which could be used by students independently\", \"To conclude, I suspect that though studying process is tightly related to guided learning, technological development and detrimental sides of providing information through human will change the perspective of educating systems\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"The traditional educational process typically assumes that students are learning under supervision o\", \"type\": \"coherence\", \"fix\": \"Consider improving the coherence & cohesion aspect here.\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Use more varied linking words to connect your ideas.\", \"Improve paragraph structure with clearer topic sentences.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Lexical Resource\", \"band\": 4.5, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"The traditional educational process typically assumes that students are learning under supervision of a teacher in a classroom\", \"Internet is already full of reliable sources, which could be used by students independently\", \"To conclude, I suspect that though studying process is tightly related to guided learning, technological development and detrimental sides of providing information through human will change the perspective of educating systems\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"The traditional educational process typically assumes that students are learning under supervision o\", \"type\": \"lexical\", \"fix\": \"Consider improving the lexical resource aspect here.\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Use more sophisticated vocabulary and avoid repetition.\", \"Focus on precise word choice and natural collocations.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Grammatical Range & Accuracy\", \"band\": 5.5, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"The traditional educational process typically assumes that students are learning under supervision of a teacher in a classroom\", \"Internet is already full of reliable sources, which could be used by students independently\", \"To conclude, I suspect that though studying process is tightly related to guided learning, technological development and detrimental sides of providing information through human will change the perspective of educating systems\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"The traditional educational process typically assumes that students are learning under supervision o\", \"type\": \"grammar\", \"fix\": \"Consider improving the grammatical range & accuracy aspect here.\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Use more complex sentence structures.\", \"Check for grammatical errors and improve accuracy.\"]}], \"overall\": 5.0, \"votes\": [5.0, 5.0, 5.0], \"dispersion\": 0.0, \"confidence\": \"high\", \"meta\": {\"prompt_hash\": \"training_data\", \"model\": \"training\", \"schema_version\": \"v1\", \"rubric_version\": \"rubric/v1\", \"token_usage\": {\"input_tokens\": 289, \"output_tokens\": 500}}}"}]}

Social workers main aim is to provide the appropriate resources to function the culture properly.

To what extent do you agree or disagree?\n\nScore this IELTS Task 2 essay according to the rubric, ensuring alignment with the question:\n\nIt is suggested that punishments for immature offenders who violate standard norms should be equivalent to those imposed on adult criminals. From my perspective, I do not disagree with this idea.\r\n\r\nThe primary reason why authorities should impose equal punishments for all criminals, regardless of their age, is the severity of the crimes committed. Given that the younger generation is growing up in a technology-driven era, it is inevitable that they will be exposed to violent video games and movies, which could have a detrimental effect on their mental health and decision-making ability, ultimately leading them to commit heinous crimes. For instance, in Vietnam a few years ago, a teenager named Le Van Luyen murdered three members of an unfamiliar family, with the intention of stealing their property to indulge his gaming addiction. Despite being under 18 years old at the time, he was not completely absolved of responsibility for his heinous act.\r\n\r\nMoreover, based on scientific research, it has been concluded that the decision-making abilities of immature individuals are not yet fully developed. Therefore, it is argued that juvenile offenders should not be held fully accountable for their illegal deeds. This assertion raises the possibility that the occurrence of heinous crimes committed by increasingly younger individuals may be attributed to the exploitation of this vulnerability, allowing them to engage in brutal activities without fearing any significant consequences. For example, consider school violence, where students who engage in abusive behaviour often go unpunished by both the school and legal system.\r\n\r\nTo summarize, it is important to ensure that penalties for breaking the law are equitable for both young and adult offenders, as younger individuals are aware of the serious consequences of their actions.

To what extent do you agree or disagree?\n\nScore this IELTS Task 2 essay according to the rubric, ensuring alignment with the question:\n\nThe thought of some experts, is that people from rich countries are not satisfied by an hypothetical increase in their economy. In this essay I will discuss this point of view and I will explain why I am not sure I agree with that.\n\nIt is generally believed by some professional figures, that additionals rise in economic wealth is not so crucial for a rich country. People from countries such as Japan, the U.S.A, Switzerland or Cina are aware of their wide economic power and these governments offer a lot of benefits for their citizens. Thus, people have yet what they want, such as funding for projects, well-organized cities,and  a lot of job opportunities. In fact, they do not feel a significant sense of satisfaction with the increase in their economy.\n\nMade this point, it is also true that some surveys used by The Italian University of Parma, reveal that citizens from countries which a strong economy, are really grateful and satisfied by any additional rise, in the economic sector. As consequence due to this increase, they can ask for more funding for some start  up or to improve the technology equipment in schools.

While some claim that it is necessary to invest in them, the opposite holds a strong view that it is a wasted expenditure. \r\n\r\nWithout a shadow of a doubt, the authority should give support to artists but not all, just to the ones who are worthy, especially focusing on traditional artists. In the present day, more and more people are listening to modern music such as Pop, Ballad, and Rock to name a few, which means followers of traditional music are decreasing sharply. Due to this reality, in order to explore cultural identity, the governor should offer assistance to the artists in the form of cash or a promotion. For example, the council support to performers in conventional music such as Cheo, Tuong, and Quan Ho so they can perform in certain festivals. Therefore, supporting talented artists is an effective way for the government to preserve cultural heritage.\r\n\r\nWhile spending money on artists is widely acknowledged, some people believe that contributing resources to art creators is an inappropriate investment. Every country had a limited budget so the governor needs to allocate it to other priority aspects of life such as education, public service, economics and so on. For example, in some underdeveloped countries like Cambodia, Myanmar and Angola, to name a few, where the living condition still maintain at low levels, providing artists with assistance, especially in money can be a wasted expenditure. Hence, the authorities in these countries should take into consideration other important aspects instead of the art field.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, governors should pay attention to potential art creators to help them maintain their careers and explore traditional values.

In my opinion, the advantages of having artificial intelligence outweigh the disadvantages. \r\n\r\nThere are many positive things  happening in society due to robots. Firstly, In most sectors nowadays wherever the labour force is required was replaced with robotics. For example, robotic equipment in construction sites minimises  manpower requirement. so, this sector does not need to depend on manpower. Secondly, artificial intelligence is helping us in day-to-day life such as robotic vacuum cleaners, automatic cars and many more. Moreover, Due to the advancement in robotic technology in the medical field can be able to do  surgeries very effectively. Another important aspect is that we all make some mistakes in the workplace that we call  human errors. If we use robots there is no chance of a such types of errors. Hence, precision is high. We have seen so many advantages of having robots in the present-day world and this technology is growly rapidly. Therefore it definitely is a bone to  human future development. \r\n\r\nEven though, using robotics has many advantages but it has a few disadvantages too. one negative impact is that we are losing jobs due to the replacement of robots in various sectors. The most affected community is the labour force. For Instance, these days many industries use robots instead of humans. Another important adverse factor is the advancement in artificial intelligence in some fields like automatic cars which is extremely life-threatening.

Other people believe that children should be taught this at home. \n Discuss both opinions and give your own opinion.\n\nScore this IELTS Task 2 essay according to the rubric, ensuring alignment with the question:\n\nIt is very important to recycle materials and reduce the amount of waste, and teach these principles to the children, but there is a disagreement among the experts about the appropriate place for educating the children. Some believe schools are the best place for teaching the value of recycling, whereas others consider homes as the best location. This essay will discuss both points of view and I shall argue that the children should be educated about this important issue at home.\r\n\r\nOn the one hand, some believe that like most of the other learning, the value of recycling waste should also be taught at home. The process of learning for a toddler begins even before he joins a school. Because, children spend much more time at their homes and tend to follow the habits of their parents, the home is the best place to teach this important value. For instance, it is well known that babies begin to form habits during early childhood. The foundation of many good habits such as reading and self discipline is laid at home. Therefore, they argue that the education about material recycling should be given at the home.\r\n\r\nOne the other hand, I would argue that these valuable habits should be inculcated at the school. It is well established that children listen to their teachers more than the parents, and at school they also learn by observing the behaviour of their peers. Schools provide the perfect atmosphere for learning because of a formal and enabling environment. If information about the value of recycling the waste is shared in school along with a practical demonstration, the children are more likely to retain this information and practice this at their homes. For example, a recent Swedish study demonstrated that on average the students retain more information which is taught at school compared to the one provided at home. \r\n\r\nIn conclusion, though there are convincing arguments on both sides, it is abundantly clear that because children are more likely to learn more and better in schools, they ought to be educated about this important issue in schools.\n\nProvide your assessment in the specified JSON format."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"per_criterion\": [{\"name\": \"Task Response\", \"band\": 8.5, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"It is very important to recycle materials and reduce the amount of waste, and teach these principles to the children, but there is a disagreement among the experts about the appropriate place for educating the children\", \"The foundation of many good habits such as reading and self discipline is laid at home\", \"In conclusion, though there are convincing arguments on both sides, it is abundantly clear that because children are more likely to learn more and better in schools, they ought to be educated about this important issue in schools\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"It is very important to recycle materials and reduce the amount of waste, and teach these principles\", \"type\": \"task\", \"fix\": \"Consider improving the task response aspect here.\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Develop your main arguments more fully with specific examples.\", \"Ensure you address all parts of the question directly.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Coherence & Cohesion\", \"band\": 7.5, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"It is very important to recycle materials and reduce the amount of waste, and teach these principles to the children, but there is a disagreement among the experts about the appropriate place for educating the children\", \"The foundation of many good habits such as reading and self discipline is laid at home\", \"In conclusion, though there are convincing arguments on both sides, it is abundantly clear that because children are more likely to learn more and better in schools, they ought to be educated about this important issue in schools\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"It is very important to recycle materials and reduce the amount of waste, and teach these principles\", \"type\": \"coherence\", \"fix\": \"Consider improving the coherence & cohesion aspect here.\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Use more varied linking words to connect your ideas.\", \"Improve paragraph structure with clearer topic sentences.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Lexical Resource\", \"band\": 7.5, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"It is very important to recycle materials and reduce the amount of waste, and teach these principles to the children, but there is a disagreement among the experts about the appropriate place for educating the children\", \"The foundation of many good habits such as reading and self discipline is laid at home\", \"In conclusion, though there are convincing arguments on both sides, it is abundantly clear that because children are more likely to learn more and better in schools, they ought to be educated about this important issue in schools\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"It is very important to recycle materials and reduce the amount of waste, and teach these principles\", \"type\": \"lexical\", \"fix\": \"Consider improving the lexical resource aspect here.\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Use more sophisticated vocabulary and avoid repetition.\", \"Focus on precise word choice and natural collocations.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Grammatical Range & Accuracy\", \"band\": 8.5, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"It is very important to recycle materials and reduce the amount of waste, and teach these principles to the children, but there is a disagreement among the experts about the appropriate place for educating the children\", \"The foundation of many good habits such as reading and self discipline is laid at home\", \"In conclusion, though there are convincing arguments on both sides, it is abundantly clear that because children are more likely to learn more and better in schools, they ought to be educated about this important issue in schools\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"It is very important to recycle materials and reduce the amount of waste, and teach these principles\", \"type\": \"grammar\", \"fix\": \"Consider improving the grammatical range & accuracy aspect here.\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Use more complex sentence structures.\", \"Check for grammatical errors and improve accuracy.\"]}], \"overall\": 8.0, \"votes\": [8.0, 8.0, 8.0], \"dispersion\": 0.0, \"confidence\": \"high\", \"meta\": {\"prompt_hash\": \"training_data\", \"model\": \"training\", \"schema_version\": \"v1\", \"rubric_version\": \"rubric/v1\", \"token_usage\": {\"input_tokens\": 385, \"output_tokens\": 500}}}"}]}

What is your opinion?\n\nScore this IELTS Task 2 essay according to the rubric, ensuring alignment with the question:\n\nIt is often a debated topic that artificially intelligent robots will progressively replace human tasks in the workplace. Although, it is evident that most menial jobs will be done by robots: however, it is unlikely that jobs that require human touch will be taken over. This essay will discuss why eventually only very few jobs will be carried out by people. \r\n\r\nTo begin with, it is admittedly true that robots make some jobs easier to complete effectively which does not require specific and complex skills. Simple jobs that are repetitive and conditional in nature can be automated. This is the reason many companies are using robots these days to obviate the cost of manpower and increase their productivity. For instance, an Automated teller machine is used to withdraw and deposit cash in time which in turn tremendously eradicated human interaction and save time. For these reasons, some unskilled work would be replaced by robot automation in the coming future. \r\n\r\nOn the other hand, there are some human jobs that can never be superseded by robots because they will never achieve the capacity to do it. In other words, they require human cognitive touch.

Discuss both views and give your opinion.\n\nScore this IELTS Task 2 essay according to the rubric, ensuring alignment with the question:\n\nPeople these days have different views about what students should do after they leave school. While many people claim that school leavers should secure a job, I would claim that it is better for them to pursue universities or colleges.\n\nOn the one hand, for those who want to get a job straight after high school, they believe that this is beneficial for some reasons. Firstly, since they take part in workforce early, they can make money and save a large amount of money which enable them to afford their interest in travelling or shopping. In fact, they can get payment each month and do not have to waste money on tuition fee or school materials. Secondly, this can be seen as an opportunity for the young to accumulate practical experience and useful skills. This can be explained by the face that curriculums in accademic institution include many subjects which might not concentrate on the skills meeting the demand of the jobs. Therefore, getting involve in the real workforce can be a good ways to develop these skills. \n\nOn the other hand, I believe that the school leavers should attend higher school as it is the best way to success in their future career. First of all, most of the top careers which receive admiration from the public require accademic qualifications as an essential condition to be hired. For example, to become a doctor of a layer, individuals are forced to study 4-6 years in universities otherwise their appication would be not meet the requirement of the occupation. In addition, those who graduate from accademic institution have a better chance to get high salary jobs.  That is because they are classified in qualified employees who is taught to think and solve problem logically. Certaintly, the employers have more interest in people with university's degree than school leavers and are more likely to be willing to pay more for them. \n\nIn conclusion, while many people believe peole should get a job straight after school, I would argue that university can give them a better future in their career. \n\n\n\nProvide your assessment in the specified JSON format."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"per_criterion\": [{\"name\": \"Task Response\", \"band\": 6.5, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"People these days have different views about what students should do after they leave school\", \"Therefore, getting involve in the real workforce can be a good ways to develop these skills\", \"In conclusion, while many people believe peole should get a job straight after school, I would argue that university can give them a better future in their career\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"People these days have different views about what students should do after they leave school\", \"type\": \"task\", \"fix\": \"Consider improving the task response aspect here.\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Develop your main arguments more fully with specific examples.\", \"Ensure you address all parts of the question directly.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Coherence & Cohesion\", \"band\": 5.5, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"People these days have different views about what students should do after they leave school\", \"Therefore, getting involve in the real workforce can be a good ways to develop these skills\", \"In conclusion, while many people believe peole should get a job straight after school, I would argue that university can give them a better future in their career\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"People these days have different views about what students should do after they leave school\", \"type\": \"coherence\", \"fix\": \"Consider improving the coherence & cohesion aspect here.\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Use more varied linking words to connect your ideas.\", \"Improve paragraph structure with clearer topic sentences.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Lexical Resource\", \"band\": 5.5, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"People these days have different views about what students should do after they leave school\", \"Therefore, getting involve in the real workforce can be a good ways to develop these skills\", \"In conclusion, while many people believe peole should get a job straight after school, I would argue that university can give them a better future in their career\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"People these days have different views about what students should do after they leave school\", \"type\": \"lexical\", \"fix\": \"Consider improving the lexical resource aspect here.\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Use more sophisticated vocabulary and avoid repetition.\", \"Focus on precise word choice and natural collocations.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Grammatical Range & Accuracy\", \"band\": 6.5, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"People these days have different views about what students should do after they leave school\", \"Therefore, getting involve in the real workforce can be a good ways to develop these skills\", \"In conclusion, while many people believe peole should get a job straight after school, I would argue that university can give them a better future in their career\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"People these days have different views about what students should do after they leave school\", \"type\": \"grammar\", \"fix\": \"Consider improving the grammatical range & accuracy aspect here.\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Use more complex sentence structures.\", \"Check for grammatical errors and improve accuracy.\"]}], \"overall\": 6.0, \"votes\": [6.0, 6.0, 6.0], \"dispersion\": 0.0, \"confidence\": \"high\", \"meta\": {\"prompt_hash\": \"training_data\", \"model\": \"training\", \"schema_version\": \"v1\", \"rubric_version\": \"rubric/v1\", \"token_usage\": {\"input_tokens\": 385, \"output_tokens\": 500}}}"}]}

On one hand, TV programs and computer games which contain brutal content are usually believed to be the cause of some people committing crimes. Those programs usually contain bloodstained scenes, and violent action; therefore, many people can be influenced and redo what they saw. For example, combat in an action movie can lead people, especially children to imitate and cause a fight in real life. More important, because some countries have bad censorship, children can easy to access and be affected by spoiled content. Most violent programs and games are censored content that has an age restriction for adults only; however, by the internet insecurity, this content is considered ubiquitous, therefore many teenagers can access them before being coincidently negatively affected. \r\n\r\nIn contrast, I believe many characters in this category are exemplary, so people can learn their good characteristics. Several violent scenes on TV and in games are related to reality.; therefore, many people tend to sympathize with the circumstance of the involved characters. For example, after watching “John Wick” – a movie related to the assassination and brutal fights, many people sympathize with the main character when he loses everything related to his dead wife; therefore, people understand the agony of losing their relatives. \r\n\r\nIn conclusion, I strongly believed that violent games can change people’s behavior in a positive way besides having some mentioned bad effects that many people have considered.\n\nProvide your assessment in the specified JSON format."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"per_criterion\": [{\"name\": \"Task Response\", \"band\": 7.0, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"The better the development of digital technology, the more games, and television programs are produced\", \"More important, because some countries have bad censorship, children can easy to access and be affected by spoiled content\", \"In conclusion, I strongly believed that violent games can change people’s behavior in a positive way besides having some mentioned bad effects that many people have considered\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"The better the development of digital technology, the more games, and television programs are produc\", \"type\": \"task\", \"fix\": \"Consider improving the task response aspect here.\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Develop your main arguments more fully with specific examples.\", \"Ensure you address all parts of the question directly.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Coherence & Cohesion\", \"band\": 6.0, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"The better the development of digital technology, the more games, and television programs are produced\", \"More important, because some countries have bad censorship, children can easy to access and be affected by spoiled content\", \"In conclusion, I strongly believed that violent games can change people’s behavior in a positive way besides having some mentioned bad effects that many people have considered\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"The better the development of digital technology, the more games, and television programs are produc\", \"type\": \"coherence\", \"fix\": \"Consider improving the coherence & cohesion aspect here.\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Use more varied linking words to connect your ideas.\", \"Improve paragraph structure with clearer topic sentences.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Lexical Resource\", \"band\": 6.0, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"The better the development of digital technology, the more games, and television programs are produced\", \"More important, because some countries have bad censorship, children can easy to access and be affected by spoiled content\", \"In conclusion, I strongly believed that violent games can change people’s behavior in a positive way besides having some mentioned bad effects that many people have considered\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"The better the development of digital technology, the more games, and television programs are produc\", \"type\": \"lexical\", \"fix\": \"Consider improving the lexical resource aspect here.\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Use more sophisticated vocabulary and avoid repetition.\", \"Focus on precise word choice and natural collocations.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Grammatical Range & Accuracy\", \"band\": 7.0, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"The better the development of digital technology, the more games, and television programs are produced\", \"More important, because some countries have bad censorship, children can easy to access and be affected by spoiled content\", \"In conclusion, I strongly believed that violent games can change people’s behavior in a positive way besides having some mentioned bad effects that many people have considered\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"The better the development of digital technology, the more games, and television programs are produc\", \"type\": \"grammar\", \"fix\": \"Consider improving the grammatical range & accuracy aspect here.\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Use more complex sentence structures.\", \"Check for grammatical errors and improve accuracy.\"]}], \"overall\": 6.5, \"votes\": [6.5, 6.5, 6.5], \"dispersion\": 0.0, \"confidence\": \"high\", \"meta\": {\"prompt_hash\": \"training_data\", \"model\": \"training\", \"schema_version\": \"v1\", \"rubric_version\": \"rubric/v1\", \"token_usage\": {\"input_tokens\": 329, \"output_tokens\": 500}}}"}]}

As a result, the enhanced cross-cultural understanding on a global scale is a the leading beneficial outcome. However, critics  in many countries argue that such developments often turn out to be the biggest culprit behind the degradation of a nation's cultural identity.\r\n\r\nOn the one hand, many developing countries have experienced a significant rise in employment opportunities in addition to unparalleled economic gains. Moreover, this could have been possible only by the virtue of globalization. Not only do businesses reap the benefits from reductions in the trade barriers, but also many competent employees get opportunities to work with multinational corporations. For example, cross-border trade has encouraged the tourism industry as well as, has further developed a better understanding of the multiple vibrant cultures.  Furthermore, experiencing different ways of life, discovering new cuisine and customs and visiting cultural sites will eventually help people gain their knowledge bank and respect for other cultures.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the general complaint about international trade is that it poses as a deadly threat to the national culture. In addition, the pervasive stream of marketing campaigns by international firms has influenced the dominance of junk foods and fashion trends. Hence, in recent years the traditional lifestyle has become less favourable amongst younger generations. In addition, there is mounting evidence that a large number of minority languages are on the verge of extinction as people prefer to conduct businesses and communicate in widely used tongues like English or Chinese.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, although globalization may result in a certain loss of cultural identities, there are still more benefits of increasing trade and cross-cultural activities among countries.

Discuss the advantages and disadvantages of this.\n\nScore this IELTS Task 2 essay according to the rubric, ensuring alignment with the question:\n\nNobody is a stranger to the fact that we live in a digital world. Many experts contend that over the next 10 years, robots will take over the jobs in many industries, which are currently done by people. To my way of thinking, there are both pros and cons to this proposal in equal measure. \r\n\r\nThere are many advantages, if you ask me, to this situation. In the first place, it increases work productivity at the workplace. Machines can work much longer hours than human employees without taking breaks. Their result is much more efficient and far more accurate than employees. People may make mistakes at work, but machines do not. Added to this, they do not have to be paid. Some occasional repairs are may be required over the long periods.  This saves a great amount of money for businesses. For instance, many supermarkets in many countries use automatic customer check-out points, which avoid hiring many workers. \r\n\r\nBe that as it may, the downsides of this phenomenon, if you ask me, are just as big. For one thing, it raises the unemployment rate. People who lose jobs because of this will have no income and therefore no money to spend. This could cause serious consequences for the economy. To name but one example, governments cannot get taxes from individuals. As a result of this, governments do not have enough funds for schools, hospitals, public transport and many other facilities and infrastructure. It follows to stand, therefore, that the quality of all essential services will suffer. \r\n\r\nTurning to my own experience, the way things are when it comes to this issue in my country, China, is the same as it was across the world over. My home city of Shanghai is a classic case in point. Here, many factories use robots to make products. Many workers cannot find jobs due to the higher preferences for machines in industrial sectors. \r\n\r\nAt the end of the day, there are merits and drawbacks to all choices we make in life. It is very important that governments play a role in creating enough employment opportunities for humans.

From my perspective, I agree with the latter.\r\n\r\nTo start with, some people hold the view that the damages caused by human activities to wildlife are irreversible. The major reason is many species of plants and animals are disappeared from our planet, and it is impossible to get them back. For example, polar bears are not able to take a break while swimming because there are no lands for them to do that as the glaciers are melting due to global warming. Meanwhile, human activity is the main cause of global warming. Hence, in those people's opinions, nothing can be done to tackle this problem.\r\n\r\nThe government should introduce new law about the restriction of deforestation. This is because the disappearance of forests will speed up the extinction of species. For instance, If the government outlawed deforestation, many people would not able to cut the plants which protect the habitat for animals to live. As a result, the variety of species is guaranteed. Similarly, individuals ought to raise their awareness of environmental issues, and spread it out to others. Therefore, reducing the bad influence on species of animals and plants is not a hard thing to do.\r\n\r\nIn summary, although there are some hardships for solving save the plants and animals who all are in danger, it is our responsibility to save the world from the negative influence.\n\nProvide your assessment in the specified JSON format."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"per_criterion\": [{\"name\": \"Task Response\", \"band\": 9.0, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"In recent decades, the worlds' empty lands that do not have any use of them, have been under attack by the construction of buildings, industries, and the expansion of farm fields\", \"Hence, in those people's opinions, nothing can be done to tackle this problem\", \"In summary, although there are some hardships for solving save the plants and animals who all are in danger, it is our responsibility to save the world from the negative influence\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"In recent decades, the worlds' empty lands that do not have any use of them, have been under attack \", \"type\": \"task\", \"fix\": \"Consider improving the task response aspect here.\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Develop your main arguments more fully with specific examples.\", \"Ensure you address all parts of the question directly.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Coherence & Cohesion\", \"band\": 8.0, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"In recent decades, the worlds' empty lands that do not have any use of them, have been under attack by the construction of buildings, industries, and the expansion of farm fields\", \"Hence, in those people's opinions, nothing can be done to tackle this problem\", \"In summary, although there are some hardships for solving save the plants and animals who all are in danger, it is our responsibility to save the world from the negative influence\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"In recent decades, the worlds' empty lands that do not have any use of them, have been under attack \", \"type\": \"coherence\", \"fix\": \"Consider improving the coherence & cohesion aspect here.\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Use more varied linking words to connect your ideas.\", \"Improve paragraph structure with clearer topic sentences.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Lexical Resource\", \"band\": 8.0, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"In recent decades, the worlds' empty lands that do not have any use of them, have been under attack by the construction of buildings, industries, and the expansion of farm fields\", \"Hence, in those people's opinions, nothing can be done to tackle this problem\", \"In summary, although there are some hardships for solving save the plants and animals who all are in danger, it is our responsibility to save the world from the negative influence\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"In recent decades, the worlds' empty lands that do not have any use of them, have been under attack \", \"type\": \"lexical\", \"fix\": \"Consider improving the lexical resource aspect here.\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Use more sophisticated vocabulary and avoid repetition.\", \"Focus on precise word choice and natural collocations.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Grammatical Range & Accuracy\", \"band\": 9.0, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"In recent decades, the worlds' empty lands that do not have any use of them, have been under attack by the construction of buildings, industries, and the expansion of farm fields\", \"Hence, in those people's opinions, nothing can be done to tackle this problem\", \"In summary, although there are some hardships for solving save the plants and animals who all are in danger, it is our responsibility to save the world from the negative influence\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"In recent decades, the worlds' empty lands that do not have any use of them, have been under attack \", \"type\": \"grammar\", \"fix\": \"Consider improving the grammatical range & accuracy aspect here.\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Use more complex sentence structures.\", \"Check for grammatical errors and improve accuracy.\"]}], \"overall\": 8.5, \"votes\": [8.5, 8.5, 8.5], \"dispersion\": 0.0, \"confidence\": \"high\", \"meta\": {\"prompt_hash\": \"training_data\", \"model\": \"training\", \"schema_version\": \"v1\", \"rubric_version\": \"rubric/v1\", \"token_usage\": {\"input_tokens\": 348, \"output_tokens\": 500}}}"}]}

However, some think that the ministry should be taken responsibility to give financial help for elder folks; while others say that the retirement folks should be take care by themselve like savings and insurances. This essay discusses both viewpoints, I strongly agree with the former opinion for the following reasons. \r\n\r\nOn the one hand, the governmnet should provide a financial support for old population because they were the once tax payer when they were working and the authority used theirs' money for countrys' infrastructure advancement. Therefore, the ministry should be take care to retirement folks by giving financial support like free medical amenities, minimum amount of monthly pension and discount offer for grocery items. For example, in India gives every month Rs 1000 for theirs' residences who are getting above sixty, as a result, they can manage theirs' expenses. Therefore, the ministry should be provided money related aid for above sixty persons. \r\n\r\nOn the other hand, an individual old person should be take care by themselves namely savings and insurances. To be elaborate, they should save a minimum amount of capital for their's old age when they were being young. For instance, in India has strated a new policy of provident fund in companies, especialy in retirement age persons, as a result, they can take this money in after retirement stage. Hence, this way certainly help to an old man can be managed to theirs' expenses. \r\n\r\nTo conclude, senior citizens should be take care by the ministry nemely providing money aids and free medical supports; an individual man should be saved a minimum amount of capital for theirs' retirement period.

Contrary to, there is a broad idea that the budget of the government should be used for improving education and health. In my view, although arts have an irreplaceability for society,  there are many significant topics, such as education and health, which are waiting to be solved as a first priority. The aim of this essay is to discuss the topic with both the merits and the demerits.\r\n\r\nTo begin with, it is important to bear in mind that health and education are the fundamental rights of every humankind regardless of nationality, religion and sex. Therefore, they should be supplied immediately by the government. When the people have a right to reach a qualified education and organized health care, they would be more productive and satisfied, which is why arts also would flourish more with regards to humans which are supplied the fundamental rights. For example, Maslow Pyramid has said that individuals' needs have an important order and the first step should be handled first. With regard to this, doubtlessly education and health come before the arts as basic needs of people.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, people have been learning the nature of humans and also they are exploring a better way to express themself with the bright power of arts. They would be able to be more aware of the world and as a consequence of it, their benefit to the public should be maximized by learning arts. Furthermore, By investing in arts, the government is able to improve the life quality of the public and they would be more sensitive to the general society's drawbacks such as environmental problems and violence against women. Thus, arts have the potential to make the world a better place than now and there is no doubt that the government should spend money on arts in order to improve society and people quality.\r\n\r\nTo summarize, however teaching arts have the potential to make people more sensitive to each other and their environment, there are many significant problems that should be solved as the high priority such as education and health.\n\nProvide your assessment in the specified JSON format."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"per_criterion\": [{\"name\": \"Task Response\", \"band\": 8.0, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"The government shows a tendency to spend more money on arts than another important issue that has been thought about by many individuals\", \"For example, Maslow Pyramid has said that individuals' needs have an important order and the first step should be handled first\", \"To summarize, however teaching arts have the potential to make people more sensitive to each other and their environment, there are many significant problems that should be solved as the high priority such as education and health\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"The government shows a tendency to spend more money on arts than another important issue that has be\", \"type\": \"task\", \"fix\": \"Consider improving the task response aspect here.\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Develop your main arguments more fully with specific examples.\", \"Ensure you address all parts of the question directly.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Coherence & Cohesion\", \"band\": 7.0, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"The government shows a tendency to spend more money on arts than another important issue that has been thought about by many individuals\", \"For example, Maslow Pyramid has said that individuals' needs have an important order and the first step should be handled first\", \"To summarize, however teaching arts have the potential to make people more sensitive to each other and their environment, there are many significant problems that should be solved as the high priority such as education and health\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"The government shows a tendency to spend more money on arts than another important issue that has be\", \"type\": \"coherence\", \"fix\": \"Consider improving the coherence & cohesion aspect here.\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Use more varied linking words to connect your ideas.\", \"Improve paragraph structure with clearer topic sentences.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Lexical Resource\", \"band\": 7.0, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"The government shows a tendency to spend more money on arts than another important issue that has been thought about by many individuals\", \"For example, Maslow Pyramid has said that individuals' needs have an important order and the first step should be handled first\", \"To summarize, however teaching arts have the potential to make people more sensitive to each other and their environment, there are many significant problems that should be solved as the high priority such as education and health\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"The government shows a tendency to spend more money on arts than another important issue that has be\", \"type\": \"lexical\", \"fix\": \"Consider improving the lexical resource aspect here.\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Use more sophisticated vocabulary and avoid repetition.\", \"Focus on precise word choice and natural collocations.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Grammatical Range & Accuracy\", \"band\": 8.0, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"The government shows a tendency to spend more money on arts than another important issue that has been thought about by many individuals\", \"For example, Maslow Pyramid has said that individuals' needs have an important order and the first step should be handled first\", \"To summarize, however teaching arts have the potential to make people more sensitive to each other and their environment, there are many significant problems that should be solved as the high priority such as education and health\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"The government shows a tendency to spend more money on arts than another important issue that has be\", \"type\": \"grammar\", \"fix\": \"Consider improving the grammatical range & accuracy aspect here.\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Use more complex sentence structures.\", \"Check for grammatical errors and improve accuracy.\"]}], \"overall\": 7.5, \"votes\": [7.5, 7.5, 7.5], \"dispersion\": 0.0, \"confidence\": \"high\", \"meta\": {\"prompt_hash\": \"training_data\", \"model\": \"training\", \"schema_version\": \"v1\", \"rubric_version\": \"rubric/v1\", \"token_usage\": {\"input_tokens\": 401, \"output_tokens\": 500}}}"}]}

Nowadays, in various countries, despite the fact they are developed or under-developed crime is a serious issue which leads to imprisonment, but there are people who believe that this is not a fruitful step. In this essay, I am going to discuss why I do not agree with this thought, I am also going to discuss how we use education for improvement.\r\n\r\nIt is necessary to tackle various offensive acts to build trust and ensure within the neighbourhood, so the people live in peace and harmony. These various nations have implemented the rule to punish  offenders by keeping them in prison. This helps to keep them away from innocent beings out in cities so there is less risk of violation and transgression. But in prison, these crime mafias build their small cartels which further leads to more aggression, on the other hand when they are released after completing their sentence they again indulged in these wrong deeds. For instance, recently I was studying a criminal case which describes how a murderer gets evicted from jail and after that he becomes more dangerous as he kills all those who were witnesses in his court trial. So, keeping them away from  society seems a better solution but there is more that needs to be done.\r\n\r\nAs we have discussed,  there are cases when there is no change in the mental situation of offenders inside the jail, therefore it is required to make them educated while they are serving their punishment. This helps to make them more responsible and understand their role as a positive force within the world. The major cause of crime is lack of money which is the result of unemployment, if lawbreakers learn new things, then they are more likely to follow the right path. For instance, the Government of India has implemented a skill-based learning course within the prison so that people can grab  opportunities after they get evicted.\r\n\r\nTo conclude, it is evident to build secured prisons for wrongdoers keeps them isolated, but on the other ,hand it is also required to train them mentally, so that they will transform into good human beings.\n\nProvide your assessment in the specified JSON format."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"per_criterion\": [{\"name\": \"Task Response\", \"band\": 7.5, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"Crimes are fatal for society whether they are small thefts or serious murders, there is a negative effect of these bad actions on numerous people\", \"For instance, recently I was studying a criminal case which describes how a murderer gets evicted from jail and after that he becomes more dangerous as he kills all those who were witnesses in his court trial\", \"To conclude, it is evident to build secured prisons for wrongdoers keeps them isolated, but on the other ,hand it is also required to train them mentally, so that they will transform into good human beings\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"Crimes are fatal for society whether they are small thefts or serious murders, there is a negative e\", \"type\": \"task\", \"fix\": \"Consider improving the task response aspect here.\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Develop your main arguments more fully with specific examples.\", \"Ensure you address all parts of the question directly.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Coherence & Cohesion\", \"band\": 6.5, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"Crimes are fatal for society whether they are small thefts or serious murders, there is a negative effect of these bad actions on numerous people\", \"For instance, recently I was studying a criminal case which describes how a murderer gets evicted from jail and after that he becomes more dangerous as he kills all those who were witnesses in his court trial\", \"To conclude, it is evident to build secured prisons for wrongdoers keeps them isolated, but on the other ,hand it is also required to train them mentally, so that they will transform into good human beings\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"Crimes are fatal for society whether they are small thefts or serious murders, there is a negative e\", \"type\": \"coherence\", \"fix\": \"Consider improving the coherence & cohesion aspect here.\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Use more varied linking words to connect your ideas.\", \"Improve paragraph structure with clearer topic sentences.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Lexical Resource\", \"band\": 6.5, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"Crimes are fatal for society whether they are small thefts or serious murders, there is a negative effect of these bad actions on numerous people\", \"For instance, recently I was studying a criminal case which describes how a murderer gets evicted from jail and after that he becomes more dangerous as he kills all those who were witnesses in his court trial\", \"To conclude, it is evident to build secured prisons for wrongdoers keeps them isolated, but on the other ,hand it is also required to train them mentally, so that they will transform into good human beings\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"Crimes are fatal for society whether they are small thefts or serious murders, there is a negative e\", \"type\": \"lexical\", \"fix\": \"Consider improving the lexical resource aspect here.\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Use more sophisticated vocabulary and avoid repetition.\", \"Focus on precise word choice and natural collocations.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Grammatical Range & Accuracy\", \"band\": 7.5, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"Crimes are fatal for society whether they are small thefts or serious murders, there is a negative effect of these bad actions on numerous people\", \"For instance, recently I was studying a criminal case which describes how a murderer gets evicted from jail and after that he becomes more dangerous as he kills all those who were witnesses in his court trial\", \"To conclude, it is evident to build secured prisons for wrongdoers keeps them isolated, but on the other ,hand it is also required to train them mentally, so that they will transform into good human beings\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"Crimes are fatal for society whether they are small thefts or serious murders, there is a negative e\", \"type\": \"grammar\", \"fix\": \"Consider improving the grammatical range & accuracy aspect here.\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Use more complex sentence structures.\", \"Check for grammatical errors and improve accuracy.\"]}], \"overall\": 7.0, \"votes\": [7.0, 7.0, 7.0], \"dispersion\": 0.0, \"confidence\": \"high\", \"meta\": {\"prompt_hash\": \"training_data\", \"model\": \"training\", \"schema_version\": \"v1\", \"rubric_version\": \"rubric/v1\", \"token_usage\": {\"input_tokens\": 416, \"output_tokens\": 500}}}"}]}

They believe this would benefit both the individual teenagers and society as a whole.\n\nScore this IELTS Task 2 essay according to the rubric, ensuring alignment with the question:\n\nIn our fast-paced world, some people consider that students need to be volunteers in their spare time. However, others, including me, reckon that it is not a true way for learners to do unpaid work. This essay will give some data about why the government does not have to force them to help the local community.\r\n\r\n    There are a number of reasons why teenagers should not be permitted to work as volunteers. To begin with, most young people are already under enough pressure with their studies. Nowadays their studies require enormous energy and teachers expect their students to do all home tasks and be active during the lesson on a daily basis. If they do volunteer work, they may face  extra pressure. Moreover, doing unpaid work in their free time takes the young's  time. If they do that kind of work, they cannot find enough time for other necessary activities which are fundamental for their development.\r\n\r\n    At the same time, I do not believe that the government can take any profits from teenagers' volunteering. Although forcing young people to do unpaid work is useful for small companies that take the help, the country can not take any benefits. Instead,they disturb them. In addition to this, it may cause a protest. Most children feel used to it when they are forced to do some unpaid work. Plus, parents do not want to raise their children with such kind of work. If governments force them to do volunteering, it may cause protests among people who want that their children reside in convenient lives.\r\n\r\n    To sum up, even though taking  help from teenagers is beneficial for the local community, it may cause some hardships for the young.\n\nProvide your assessment in the specified JSON format."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"per_criterion\": [{\"name\": \"Task Response\", \"band\": 7.0, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"In our fast-paced world, some people consider that students need to be volunteers in their spare time\", \"If they do that kind of work, they cannot find enough time for other necessary activities which are fundamental for their development\", \"To sum up, even though taking  help from teenagers is beneficial for the local community, it may cause some hardships for the young\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"In our fast-paced world, some people consider that students need to be volunteers in their spare tim\", \"type\": \"task\", \"fix\": \"Consider improving the task response aspect here.\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Develop your main arguments more fully with specific examples.\", \"Ensure you address all parts of the question directly.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Coherence & Cohesion\", \"band\": 6.0, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"In our fast-paced world, some people consider that students need to be volunteers in their spare time\", \"If they do that kind of work, they cannot find enough time for other necessary activities which are fundamental for their development\", \"To sum up, even though taking  help from teenagers is beneficial for the local community, it may cause some hardships for the young\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"In our fast-paced world, some people consider that students need to be volunteers in their spare tim\", \"type\": \"coherence\", \"fix\": \"Consider improving the coherence & cohesion aspect here.\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Use more varied linking words to connect your ideas.\", \"Improve paragraph structure with clearer topic sentences.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Lexical Resource\", \"band\": 6.0, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"In our fast-paced world, some people consider that students need to be volunteers in their spare time\", \"If they do that kind of work, they cannot find enough time for other necessary activities which are fundamental for their development\", \"To sum up, even though taking  help from teenagers is beneficial for the local community, it may cause some hardships for the young\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"In our fast-paced world, some people consider that students need to be volunteers in their spare tim\", \"type\": \"lexical\", \"fix\": \"Consider improving the lexical resource aspect here.\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Use more sophisticated vocabulary and avoid repetition.\", \"Focus on precise word choice and natural collocations.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Grammatical Range & Accuracy\", \"band\": 7.0, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"In our fast-paced world, some people consider that students need to be volunteers in their spare time\", \"If they do that kind of work, they cannot find enough time for other necessary activities which are fundamental for their development\", \"To sum up, even though taking  help from teenagers is beneficial for the local community, it may cause some hardships for the young\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"In our fast-paced world, some people consider that students need to be volunteers in their spare tim\", \"type\": \"grammar\", \"fix\": \"Consider improving the grammatical range & accuracy aspect here.\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Use more complex sentence structures.\", \"Check for grammatical errors and improve accuracy.\"]}], \"overall\": 6.5, \"votes\": [6.5, 6.5, 6.5], \"dispersion\": 0.0, \"confidence\": \"high\", \"meta\": {\"prompt_hash\": \"training_data\", \"model\": \"training\", \"schema_version\": \"v1\", \"rubric_version\": \"rubric/v1\", \"token_usage\": {\"input_tokens\": 320, \"output_tokens\": 500}}}"}]}

While it is possible that all menial jobs will eventually be done by robots. It is unlikely that jobs require human contact will be taken over. This essay will discuss why eventually only very few jobs will be carried out by people.\n\n\nRobots may eventually replace all human labour that does not require specific and complex human skills. Many companies will turn to artificial intelligence because it is far less expensive than hiring, training and employing humans. In supermarkets in Australia, for example, many cashiers have been replaced by automated stations that cost far less than employees. In addition, these automated stations work around the clock and require no holidays or holiday pay. For these reasons, jobs that can be replaced by robotic intelligent will be replaced. \n\n\n\nConversely, there are some human jobs that cannot be replaced because robots will never achieve the capacity to do them. Put simply, some jobs require a ‘human touch’. They require the sophisticated social skills of a person relating to another person. These jobs include psychology, education, medicine and social work to name but a few. Robots will never be able to achieve what has taken social evolution hundreds of thousands of years to achieve.\n\n\n\nIt is increasingly likely that robots will end most human employment. Unskilled labour will eventually be done entirely by robots; however, sophisticated jobs that require human specific skills will always exist.

Moreover, their relationships are much better among other peers and others. Furthermore, it also affects their communication skills.

Last two decades a lot of young people suffer from lack of communication ability that’s why this is the best way.\r\n\r\nThe second reason is working skills. Nowadays young folks have a serious problem which is the unemployment complication. Several suicides happened last five years owing to this problem and this situation growing sharply. However, if they worked for society at early age, they gain business skills easily that’s why they never suffer from unemployment problems in their further life.

In my opinion, being employed before joining the university makes a person independent,however, continuing the academic qualification play a key role in getting better employment opportunity and be competitive in the market.\n\nOn the one hand, it is beneficial to start working directly after school to be independent. This is because, when a student starts their career in an early stage, they do not have to rely on others for their expenses and bills. As a result, they can have a free life with own earnings and satisfaction. For an example, according to the Australian Times published on 2019, people who have started their job, career after schooling are happier in self-supporting in comparison with highly qualified people.\n\nOn the other hand, there are significant benefits of continuing the high level of qualification. Firstly, there will be a big chance of getting better jobs. If a person has a high degree of education, there is an opportunity to be employed in top professional. For an instant, to be a Doctor, a relevant degree is required, which is impossible to get from schooling. As a result, university graduates have big hope for higher position. Secondly, there is a big competition in the market. Most of the position requires good educational background, and if young people have qualified from university or college they will be able to compete with others.\n\nIn conclusion, joining the workplace before postgraduate or undergraduate can help to be self-supporting, while continuing the study helps to get better jobs and compete with others.

In the forthcoming paragraphs, I am going to examine this question from both points of  view and then explain my opinion.\r\n\r\nThere are people who argue that the benefits of internet community considerably outweigh it is demerits. The main reason for believing this is that social platform may increase populations bond and makes them feel more social. For instance, the social webcite can help immigrants to see their families virtualy even though their relatives live in another part of the world. Therefore, Using social network may help public to not feel alone. Indeed, this makes it clear that social platform has many positives to people's life.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, others believe that the use of social network may cause more harmful to societies. populations often have this opinion because social platform may increase distaction and prevents people to perform their jobs effectively. To illustrate, a prestigious journal article published a study stated that 50% of teenagers who use the internet on regular basis tend to fail in their exams. Moreover, on long terms, networkers becomes addictors to social webcites. Thus, it becomes apparent that social platform might cause more harm to the population.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, I believe both arguments have their merits.

Namely, people have to deal with more difficulties and sadness in living , and society forces them with more problems in taking care of elderly individuals .  However, this has some advantages that will be discussed in the following essay.\r\n\r\nIt is expected that the life expectancy of individuals raises and it has some disadvantages. Initially, if the length of life were more, humans would face  more difficulties in their lives, because living is full of sadnesses and socially and family problems . For ,example a 90-year-old one is likely to see the death of a family member that has a high level of stress. Additionally, society must provide some facilities for the elderly that need a high budget, thus more than 70 years of individuals force more costs on the government. For instance, they need medicine , hospitals, social services ,etc. \r\n\r\nOn the other hand, when ones live more than 80 year old , it has some benefits . For instance, they have more opportunities for being happy, because they have more time in their lives, thus if they used their life correctly they would have more opportunities to be successful. For instance, 80 years old is enough time to spend on learning useful skills and taking benefit of them . \r\n\r\nIn conclusion, the advantages and disadvantages of living longer are equal and depend on how people use their lives, in addition to how government manage this situation .\n\nProvide your assessment in the specified JSON format."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"per_criterion\": [{\"name\": \"Task Response\", \"band\": 8.0, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"According to one study , it is shown that in developed countries people are assumed to live more than before\", \"For ,example a 90-year-old one is likely to see the death of a family member that has a high level of stress\", \"In conclusion, the advantages and disadvantages of living longer are equal and depend on how people use their lives, in addition to how government manage this situation\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"According to one study , it is shown that in developed countries people are assumed to live more tha\", \"type\": \"task\", \"fix\": \"Consider improving the task response aspect here.\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Develop your main arguments more fully with specific examples.\", \"Ensure you address all parts of the question directly.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Coherence & Cohesion\", \"band\": 7.0, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"According to one study , it is shown that in developed countries people are assumed to live more than before\", \"For ,example a 90-year-old one is likely to see the death of a family member that has a high level of stress\", \"In conclusion, the advantages and disadvantages of living longer are equal and depend on how people use their lives, in addition to how government manage this situation\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"According to one study , it is shown that in developed countries people are assumed to live more tha\", \"type\": \"coherence\", \"fix\": \"Consider improving the coherence & cohesion aspect here.\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Use more varied linking words to connect your ideas.\", \"Improve paragraph structure with clearer topic sentences.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Lexical Resource\", \"band\": 7.0, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"According to one study , it is shown that in developed countries people are assumed to live more than before\", \"For ,example a 90-year-old one is likely to see the death of a family member that has a high level of stress\", \"In conclusion, the advantages and disadvantages of living longer are equal and depend on how people use their lives, in addition to how government manage this situation\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"According to one study , it is shown that in developed countries people are assumed to live more tha\", \"type\": \"lexical\", \"fix\": \"Consider improving the lexical resource aspect here.\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Use more sophisticated vocabulary and avoid repetition.\", \"Focus on precise word choice and natural collocations.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Grammatical Range & Accuracy\", \"band\": 8.0, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"According to one study , it is shown that in developed countries people are assumed to live more than before\", \"For ,example a 90-year-old one is likely to see the death of a family member that has a high level of stress\", \"In conclusion, the advantages and disadvantages of living longer are equal and depend on how people use their lives, in addition to how government manage this situation\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"According to one study , it is shown that in developed countries people are assumed to live more tha\", \"type\": \"grammar\", \"fix\": \"Consider improving the grammatical range & accuracy aspect here.\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Use more complex sentence structures.\", \"Check for grammatical errors and improve accuracy.\"]}], \"overall\": 7.5, \"votes\": [7.5, 7.5, 7.5], \"dispersion\": 0.0, \"confidence\": \"high\", \"meta\": {\"prompt_hash\": \"training_data\", \"model\": \"training\", \"schema_version\": \"v1\", \"rubric_version\": \"rubric/v1\", \"token_usage\": {\"input_tokens\": 306, \"output_tokens\": 500}}}"}]}

Similar goods and products are available all over the world via e-commerce websites and offline markets. In this essay, we will discuss both positive and negative aspects of it.\r\n\r\nTo begin with, international trade has increased exponentially in the last 2 decades due to technological advancement and brand establishments. Big brands like Zara, Gucci and Prada have their presence across the globe. Their stores can be found in almost all the countries. Just like this brand's, there are many other brand's which are available across the globe. Due to globalisation, it has become convenient for buyers to buy products of international brands in their own country. Initially, only people who could afford to travel to different countries were able to buy international products. However, now the scenario has changed and many of this brand's shops are available in almost all the countries where people can buy them offline or they can order them online.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, there are a few negative aspects of having similar shops and products in different countries. First, there is no diversity in designs. Similar designs can be found in different countries. Second, countries lack the authenticity of their local products as they are available or listed on platforms like amazon which allows sellers to sell products internationally. For example, recently one of my colleagues had visited Paris for her vacation. she wanted to do some shopping in Paris however, she could not find any unique design which she can buy as a souvenir. Those same shops and designs were also available in her home country with a minimal variation in price.\r\n\r\nTo sum up, there are many benefits which surpass the negative aspects of having similar shops across the globe as this give a homelike feeling to someone who is planning to stay in a different country for months or years.\n\nProvide your assessment in the specified JSON format."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"per_criterion\": [{\"name\": \"Task Response\", \"band\": 8.0, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"Nowadays, globalisation has led to international trade across many countries\", \"However, now the scenario has changed and many of this brand's shops are available in almost all the countries where people can buy them offline or they can order them online\", \"To sum up, there are many benefits which surpass the negative aspects of having similar shops across the globe as this give a homelike feeling to someone who is planning to stay in a different country for months or years\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"Nowadays, globalisation has led to international trade across many countries\", \"type\": \"task\", \"fix\": \"Consider improving the task response aspect here.\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Develop your main arguments more fully with specific examples.\", \"Ensure you address all parts of the question directly.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Coherence & Cohesion\", \"band\": 7.0, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"Nowadays, globalisation has led to international trade across many countries\", \"However, now the scenario has changed and many of this brand's shops are available in almost all the countries where people can buy them offline or they can order them online\", \"To sum up, there are many benefits which surpass the negative aspects of having similar shops across the globe as this give a homelike feeling to someone who is planning to stay in a different country for months or years\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"Nowadays, globalisation has led to international trade across many countries\", \"type\": \"coherence\", \"fix\": \"Consider improving the coherence & cohesion aspect here.\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Use more varied linking words to connect your ideas.\", \"Improve paragraph structure with clearer topic sentences.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Lexical Resource\", \"band\": 7.0, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"Nowadays, globalisation has led to international trade across many countries\", \"However, now the scenario has changed and many of this brand's shops are available in almost all the countries where people can buy them offline or they can order them online\", \"To sum up, there are many benefits which surpass the negative aspects of having similar shops across the globe as this give a homelike feeling to someone who is planning to stay in a different country for months or years\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"Nowadays, globalisation has led to international trade across many countries\", \"type\": \"lexical\", \"fix\": \"Consider improving the lexical resource aspect here.\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Use more sophisticated vocabulary and avoid repetition.\", \"Focus on precise word choice and natural collocations.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Grammatical Range & Accuracy\", \"band\": 8.0, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"Nowadays, globalisation has led to international trade across many countries\", \"However, now the scenario has changed and many of this brand's shops are available in almost all the countries where people can buy them offline or they can order them online\", \"To sum up, there are many benefits which surpass the negative aspects of having similar shops across the globe as this give a homelike feeling to someone who is planning to stay in a different country for months or years\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"Nowadays, globalisation has led to international trade across many countries\", \"type\": \"grammar\", \"fix\": \"Consider improving the grammatical range & accuracy aspect here.\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Use more complex sentence structures.\", \"Check for grammatical errors and improve accuracy.\"]}], \"overall\": 7.5, \"votes\": [7.5, 7.5, 7.5], \"dispersion\": 0.0, \"confidence\": \"high\", \"meta\": {\"prompt_hash\": \"training_data\", \"model\": \"training\", \"schema_version\": \"v1\", \"rubric_version\": \"rubric/v1\", \"token_usage\": {\"input_tokens\": 347, \"output_tokens\": 500}}}"}]}

So then it is a waste of time to read the newspaper and watch television news programs. To what extent do you agree or disagree?\n\nScore this IELTS Task 2 essay according to the rubric, ensuring alignment with the question:\n\nIn today’s society, people have various viewpoints on whether news has no correlation to people’s lives. Many believe that reading the newspaper and watching television news programs are meaningless as they are irrelevant to people’s daily routine.While I agree that news has no connection to human’s lives, I also believe that people should spend their time reading the newspapers and watching television news programs.\r\n\r\nOn the one hand, the argument that news is not connected to daily’s lives is reasonable, due to the fact that news these days is sometimes outdated and lacks  authenticity. In reality, there are yellow journalists who rely on profits instead of giving citizens access to meaningful stories. For instance, Vietnamese reporters usually make the hottest headlines about the death of some renowned celebrities namely Phuong My Chi, which leads to a focus of publicity and controversy. Therefore, viewers can be misunderstanding about the publicity that they are following and waste their time in the process.\r\n\r\nHowere, I also think that people should spend time speculating  on the newspapers and watching television news programs. Firstly, news is appearing increasingly eye-catching and with informative content, rather than sensational news in the past.It is undeniable that news is the information and reports about the event that occurred in recent times, and they are categorized into various fields , so watching news means pondering specific fields of business. For example, while businesses can watch news to know what is happening with the economy, people who like sports can watch news about competitions in sports fields to relax. Moreover, during the Covid 19-pandemic, watching news can help people know more information about vaccine, diseases as soon as possible to protect their health.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, while I agree that news has no correlation to people’s lives, I also believe that people should spend their time reading the newspaper and watching television news programs to gain more knowledge from this.

What extent do you agree or disagree?\n\nScore this IELTS Task 2 essay according to the rubric, ensuring alignment with the question:\n\nRoad safety is a very important and concerning matter. Carelessness while driving can lead to severe accidents. Therefore, the only way to improve the safety of our roads is to give much stricter punishments for driving offences. According to my perspective, I completely agree with administering severe penance for any kind of recklessness or irresponsibility on the streets as any mistake can cause someone to lose his or her life. In the essay, I will discuss the reason that lead to accidents and why severe penalizing is necessary for such delinquency.\r\n\r\n Firstly, punctuality is a major reason for mishaps on the highways. To put it more simply, people speed on the highways and break traffic rules when they are getting late to reach their destination. To illustrate, suppose a man needs to reach work by 8 but he started off late from home. So now to get to the office quickly he will break the speed limit which is very dangerous and can create disasters any moment he loses control. He might injure himself badly or even worse die.\r\n\r\n Secondly, drunk driving also originates tragedies on highways. Often youngsters drink and drive which results in them losing control and crashing into something else. It is very concerning as it can severely injure someone or even worse take someone's life. Likewise, teenagers speed on the tracks as being part of a racing competition or just for fun or adventure which is unacceptable because all of this promotes mishaps.\r\n\r\n To conclude, folks have a very casual attitude towards traffic laws. They are more prone to breaking them despite the fact that it can save their lives. Hence as mentioned earlier in the essay, I hold the view that the only way for the betterment of road safety is to administer severe penance on speeding offences on the streets as nothing is more important than life.\n\nProvide your assessment in the specified JSON format."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"per_criterion\": [{\"name\": \"Task Response\", \"band\": 8.0, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"Road safety is a very important and concerning matter\", \"So now to get to the office quickly he will break the speed limit which is very dangerous and can create disasters any moment he loses control\", \"Hence as mentioned earlier in the essay, I hold the view that the only way for the betterment of road safety is to administer severe penance on speeding offences on the streets as nothing is more important than life\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"Road safety is a very important and concerning matter\", \"type\": \"task\", \"fix\": \"Consider improving the task response aspect here.\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Develop your main arguments more fully with specific examples.\", \"Ensure you address all parts of the question directly.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Coherence & Cohesion\", \"band\": 7.0, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"Road safety is a very important and concerning matter\", \"So now to get to the office quickly he will break the speed limit which is very dangerous and can create disasters any moment he loses control\", \"Hence as mentioned earlier in the essay, I hold the view that the only way for the betterment of road safety is to administer severe penance on speeding offences on the streets as nothing is more important than life\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"Road safety is a very important and concerning matter\", \"type\": \"coherence\", \"fix\": \"Consider improving the coherence & cohesion aspect here.\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Use more varied linking words to connect your ideas.\", \"Improve paragraph structure with clearer topic sentences.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Lexical Resource\", \"band\": 7.0, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"Road safety is a very important and concerning matter\", \"So now to get to the office quickly he will break the speed limit which is very dangerous and can create disasters any moment he loses control\", \"Hence as mentioned earlier in the essay, I hold the view that the only way for the betterment of road safety is to administer severe penance on speeding offences on the streets as nothing is more important than life\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"Road safety is a very important and concerning matter\", \"type\": \"lexical\", \"fix\": \"Consider improving the lexical resource aspect here.\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Use more sophisticated vocabulary and avoid repetition.\", \"Focus on precise word choice and natural collocations.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Grammatical Range & Accuracy\", \"band\": 8.0, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"Road safety is a very important and concerning matter\", \"So now to get to the office quickly he will break the speed limit which is very dangerous and can create disasters any moment he loses control\", \"Hence as mentioned earlier in the essay, I hold the view that the only way for the betterment of road safety is to administer severe penance on speeding offences on the streets as nothing is more important than life\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"Road safety is a very important and concerning matter\", \"type\": \"grammar\", \"fix\": \"Consider improving the grammatical range & accuracy aspect here.\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Use more complex sentence structures.\", \"Check for grammatical errors and improve accuracy.\"]}], \"overall\": 7.5, \"votes\": [7.5, 7.5, 7.5], \"dispersion\": 0.0, \"confidence\": \"high\", \"meta\": {\"prompt_hash\": \"training_data\", \"model\": \"training\", \"schema_version\": \"v1\", \"rubric_version\": \"rubric/v1\", \"token_usage\": {\"input_tokens\": 339, \"output_tokens\": 500}}}"}]}

I agree that rich countries can't provide more satisfaction for their people just increasing economics.

This phenomenon has been discussed a lot during this decade and it is fair that teachers speak about this argument with their pupils in order to learn how to treat our environment.

I will shed light on the issues in the following essay. \r\n\r\nTo begin with, people opt to travel abroad rather than within their own countries for three main reasons. First of all, many people are to study different things surrounding the country they visit. For example, most parents and their children often visit historical sites such as temples, museums, and pagodas. Consequently, encouraging young children's development and curiosity. Additionally, people can explore when they visit different nations, which enriches their knowledge. Secondly, some individuals go overseas to breathtaking locations, like islands and resorts in the mountains, which are unlike anything they would find at home, to relax. Finally, visitors can learn more about history, culture, and cuisine by traveling outside the country. \r\n\r\nIn my view, the tendency to travel overseas is increasing this phenomenon would be a positive development in various facets. Firstly, international traveling brings numerous economic benefits to host countries. Because selling their traditional foods and renting out houses to visitors brings in more money for the country's residents. Furthermore, the tourism industry develops, leading to created jobs and economic growth in their country. Secondly, traveling overseas help people improve their language skill and life experiences. For instance, travelers need to learn a few local languages when visiting other nations, as most people there speak their tongue. \r\n\r\nIn conclusion, people travel to other countries to acquire new knowledge and relax.

This complex issue stems from a multitude of factors, and finding a solution requires a collective endeavor involving all stakeholders.\r\n\r\nThere exist several catalysts behind the expansion of the consumer industry and its subsequent negative impact on the environment. Chief among these is the rapid proliferation of consumerism. As the demand for goods escalates, the corresponding need for increased production becomes apparent. Consequently, industries engaged in manufacturing these goods have intensified their utilization of water, energy, and raw materials, resulting in the depletion of our precious natural resources. This challenge is further aggravated by inadequate environmental regulations that often fail to dissuade factories from releasing hazardous chemicals and toxic emissions into the surroundings.\r\n\r\nAddressing these pressing environmental concerns necessitates collaborative actions from individuals, businesses, and governmental bodies. Firstly, it becomes imperative for governments to launch campaigns aimed at enhancing public awareness regarding the dire environmental consequences of rampant consumerism. Armed with a comprehensive understanding of these repercussions, individuals are more likely to embrace environmentally conscious behaviors, including refraining from excessive purchasing and transitioning to eco-friendly alternatives. This shift in consumer behavior, in turn, exerts pressure on companies and manufacturers to adopt more sustainable practices. Simultaneously, it is essential to bolster punitive measures against factories that disregard proper waste management, including longer business suspensions and legal repercussions for those responsible for such environmental transgressions. This two-pronged strategy holds promise for significantly mitigating the detrimental effects stemming from heightened consumer goods production on the environment.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, the unchecked growth of consumerism, coupled with lenient environmental regulations, has paved the way for an expanding consumer industry that significantly impacts our environment.

To what extent do you agree or disagree?\n\nScore this IELTS Task 2 essay according to the rubric, ensuring alignment with the question:\n\nIt is an unfortunate reality of today's world that celebrities are cherished and celebrated, not for their achievements, but merely for their fame and wealth. Youth, in particular, views such worldly possessions of celebrities as the highest mark of human achievement. No wonder this trend has devastating effects on the younger generation. To prove this, one has to analyse how youth perceives celebrities' success in general and the fact that many amongst them don't pose the right kind of image for youth to look up to.\n\nFirstly, very few young people realise that all the fame and glory that the celebrities get to enjoy is never achieved overnight, rather it is all blood, sweat and tears. It takes years and years of struggle to get to that point, which many youngsters choose not to go through, rather, they look for shortcuts towards success. Thus, as a result, they are overcome with procrastination and laziness, which is a direct consequence of idealising the materialistic possessions of their ideals.\n\nSecondly, one should consider the fact that a number of superstars in the entertainment business are infamous who should not be looked up to in any way. For instance, musicians who use extremely obscure lyrical themes in their music, or the actors working in biographical movies dedicated to serial killers etc. These instances show that when youth venerates such forms of entertainment, they are somehow led to believe that they can also become as famous and successful merely by imitating their so-called ideals. Hence, the negative influence of such a trend is obvious.\n\nHaving analysed how glorifying the rich people, not for their hard-earned achievements, but merely for their worldly possessions, can affect youth's perception of success, it is proven that this tendency does set a bad example.

To what extent do you think are consumers influenced by advertisements? What measures can be taken to protect them?\n\nScore this IELTS Task 2 essay according to the rubric, ensuring alignment with the question:\n\nLiving in a century that is influenced materialistically, we are inundated with an array of advertisements. In my opinion, the excess practice of it, whether on TV, internet or print media, could be menacing as it invigorates people to spend more without thinking cautiously. Hence, there should be some protective measures to avert over-spending. In the following essays, I shall discuss this in detail.\n\nTo begin with, compelling advertising, showcasing attractive products and services, forces people to spend even when it is not necessary. In the present scenario, companies with massive budgets have adopted varying methods to advertise their offering, ranging from TV commercials to flyers in newspaper that it is becoming strenuous for people to escape from these activities. For instance, if you are watching a cricket match, it is very likely that you will come across logos or advertisements of sponsors. Similarly, if you are watching a web series or a movie, you will find a promotional product. At the very least, even if you are just scrolling through social media in your free time, you will find hoards of advertisements or influencers promoting products. This volume of advertising simply means that we, as consumers, are profoundly cajoled into purchasing such products without giving them enough thought.\n\nAs far as the regulation is concerned, it is not a piece of cake to decide how the advertisements can be regulated. Evidently, governments have to restrict advertisements for such products that could pose health threats or are harmful, such as tobacco, alcohol, and more.

Secondly, traffic polices are responsible for this irritating situation as they are failed to do their duty properly. Thirdly, narrow roads in busy places are also accountable for this inconvenience. Furthermore, ignorance of this problem of government can't be denied. In contrast, less amount of zebra crossings and over-bridges is another cause behind this. Moreover, a number of shops can be seen on the footpaths for which people can't use the roads properly, as a result, they have to take another way which may create a traffic jam.\r\n\r\nHowever, there can be several solutions to cope with this problem. Firstly, the government has to make the rules and regulations of traffic jams very strict. Secondly, those who will not follow these rules have to give a huge amount of fines. Thirdly, traffic policies have to be more aware to control this issue. In addition, roads should be wider at least in the rush cities and towns. Again, the transportation system should change like in Delhi after the starting of the Delhi metro rail, congestion has reduced too much. Moreover, more and more zebra crossings and over-bridges need to build in these sectors. Furthermore, the small shops which captured the footpaths have to be removed must, if people want to deal with this traffic jam.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, traffic jam is a problem which can easily sort out, if the community and government want to give them a try.\n\nProvide your assessment in the specified JSON format."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"per_criterion\": [{\"name\": \"Task Response\", \"band\": 7.5, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"At present, aerial range of congestion is the greatest problem in a number of cities as well as towns throughout the Universe\", \"However, there can be several solutions to cope with this problem\", \"In conclusion, traffic jam is a problem which can easily sort out, if the community and government want to give them a try\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"At present, aerial range of congestion is the greatest problem in a number of cities as well as town\", \"type\": \"task\", \"fix\": \"Consider improving the task response aspect here.\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Develop your main arguments more fully with specific examples.\", \"Ensure you address all parts of the question directly.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Coherence & Cohesion\", \"band\": 6.5, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"At present, aerial range of congestion is the greatest problem in a number of cities as well as towns throughout the Universe\", \"However, there can be several solutions to cope with this problem\", \"In conclusion, traffic jam is a problem which can easily sort out, if the community and government want to give them a try\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"At present, aerial range of congestion is the greatest problem in a number of cities as well as town\", \"type\": \"coherence\", \"fix\": \"Consider improving the coherence & cohesion aspect here.\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Use more varied linking words to connect your ideas.\", \"Improve paragraph structure with clearer topic sentences.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Lexical Resource\", \"band\": 6.5, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"At present, aerial range of congestion is the greatest problem in a number of cities as well as towns throughout the Universe\", \"However, there can be several solutions to cope with this problem\", \"In conclusion, traffic jam is a problem which can easily sort out, if the community and government want to give them a try\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"At present, aerial range of congestion is the greatest problem in a number of cities as well as town\", \"type\": \"lexical\", \"fix\": \"Consider improving the lexical resource aspect here.\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Use more sophisticated vocabulary and avoid repetition.\", \"Focus on precise word choice and natural collocations.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Grammatical Range & Accuracy\", \"band\": 7.5, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"At present, aerial range of congestion is the greatest problem in a number of cities as well as towns throughout the Universe\", \"However, there can be several solutions to cope with this problem\", \"In conclusion, traffic jam is a problem which can easily sort out, if the community and government want to give them a try\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"At present, aerial range of congestion is the greatest problem in a number of cities as well as town\", \"type\": \"grammar\", \"fix\": \"Consider improving the grammatical range & accuracy aspect here.\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Use more complex sentence structures.\", \"Check for grammatical errors and improve accuracy.\"]}], \"overall\": 7.0, \"votes\": [7.0, 7.0, 7.0], \"dispersion\": 0.0, \"confidence\": \"high\", \"meta\": {\"prompt_hash\": \"training_data\", \"model\": \"training\", \"schema_version\": \"v1\", \"rubric_version\": \"rubric/v1\", \"token_usage\": {\"input_tokens\": 326, \"output_tokens\": 500}}}"}]}

Make local inhabitants less social is another downside of this development. This is because people often use public parks and open spaces to socialize with their friends or people on neighborhood.

So, ones which encounter problems related to climate change must get used to situations, resulting in decreasing its harm and damage and thus saving people’s lives. For instance, in northern Turkey because of global change towns flood with heavy rain and landscapes occur more often compared to the past. Consequently, inhabitants readjust to new conditions by changing town plans or the location of their houses.\r\n\r\nIn my opinion, although climate change’s effects are rising day by day, this problem only solves by humans. Nevertheless, it comes out with human’s mistakes, it will simply be sorted out by people. If the government and all people cooperate with each other and people are educated about its adverse effects, I think we cope with that situation.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, even if people prefer to spend their time getting used to the world’s extraordinary conditions, they must tend to be cared to stop these conditions by being increased their awareness.\n\nProvide your assessment in the specified JSON format."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"per_criterion\": [{\"name\": \"Task Response\", \"band\": 7.5, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"It is considered by many that people should do their best to lessen global warming’s effects, but others believe that we should get used to living with it\", \"So, ones which encounter problems related to climate change must get used to situations, resulting in decreasing its harm and damage and thus saving people’s lives\", \"In conclusion, even if people prefer to spend their time getting used to the world’s extraordinary conditions, they must tend to be cared to stop these conditions by being increased their awareness\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"It is considered by many that people should do their best to lessen global warming’s effects, but ot\", \"type\": \"task\", \"fix\": \"Consider improving the task response aspect here.\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Develop your main arguments more fully with specific examples.\", \"Ensure you address all parts of the question directly.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Coherence & Cohesion\", \"band\": 6.5, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"It is considered by many that people should do their best to lessen global warming’s effects, but others believe that we should get used to living with it\", \"So, ones which encounter problems related to climate change must get used to situations, resulting in decreasing its harm and damage and thus saving people’s lives\", \"In conclusion, even if people prefer to spend their time getting used to the world’s extraordinary conditions, they must tend to be cared to stop these conditions by being increased their awareness\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"It is considered by many that people should do their best to lessen global warming’s effects, but ot\", \"type\": \"coherence\", \"fix\": \"Consider improving the coherence & cohesion aspect here.\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Use more varied linking words to connect your ideas.\", \"Improve paragraph structure with clearer topic sentences.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Lexical Resource\", \"band\": 6.5, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"It is considered by many that people should do their best to lessen global warming’s effects, but others believe that we should get used to living with it\", \"So, ones which encounter problems related to climate change must get used to situations, resulting in decreasing its harm and damage and thus saving people’s lives\", \"In conclusion, even if people prefer to spend their time getting used to the world’s extraordinary conditions, they must tend to be cared to stop these conditions by being increased their awareness\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"It is considered by many that people should do their best to lessen global warming’s effects, but ot\", \"type\": \"lexical\", \"fix\": \"Consider improving the lexical resource aspect here.\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Use more sophisticated vocabulary and avoid repetition.\", \"Focus on precise word choice and natural collocations.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Grammatical Range & Accuracy\", \"band\": 7.5, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"It is considered by many that people should do their best to lessen global warming’s effects, but others believe that we should get used to living with it\", \"So, ones which encounter problems related to climate change must get used to situations, resulting in decreasing its harm and damage and thus saving people’s lives\", \"In conclusion, even if people prefer to spend their time getting used to the world’s extraordinary conditions, they must tend to be cared to stop these conditions by being increased their awareness\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"It is considered by many that people should do their best to lessen global warming’s effects, but ot\", \"type\": \"grammar\", \"fix\": \"Consider improving the grammatical range & accuracy aspect here.\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Use more complex sentence structures.\", \"Check for grammatical errors and improve accuracy.\"]}], \"overall\": 7.0, \"votes\": [7.0, 7.0, 7.0], \"dispersion\": 0.0, \"confidence\": \"high\", \"meta\": {\"prompt_hash\": \"training_data\", \"model\": \"training\", \"schema_version\": \"v1\", \"rubric_version\": \"rubric/v1\", \"token_usage\": {\"input_tokens\": 337, \"output_tokens\": 500}}}"}]}

Do you agree or disagree?\n\nScore this IELTS Task 2 essay according to the rubric, ensuring alignment with the question:\n\nAs the economy is advancing by leaps and bounds, the attitude people adopt towards recruitment has undergone a noticeable and far-reaching transformation. Under this circumstance, an absolute consensus is hardly reached as to whether there are other effective alternatives to interviews which have been fundamental choosing standards. For my part, I side with the advocates to a larger extent based on the following sound reasons.\n\nFirstly, it is noteworthy that conversations fail to make a comprehensive assessment of job-seekers. Nowadays, many studies have shown that although it is invisible, the meeting in person can not make the evaluation of the honesty, loyalty and trustworthiness of applicants because of limited interaction in a short period of time. Therefore, it will be a grave mistake to overlook the fact that interviews are not the most dependable method for recruitment. For example, in some countries where employers give high weight to whole-life employment, reference from current employees is widely applied to recruit new staff rather than public advertisement and interviews. This example is the illustration of the fact that talking is not a totally reliable method for some inherited shortcomings.\n\nSecondly, the counter-argument raised by objectors is that without meeting job-seekers can not show off their abilities, and experiences. This belief could be attributed to the fact that in large measure, conversations have been widely used to check the richness of capabilities such as interpersonal interaction skills, resilience and critical thinking skill via giving questions and requiring immediate answers. This argument is true to some degree; however, it is incomplete, what they fail to take into account is that meetings can not go further to check criminal records or bank credit. For instance, according to some research, when it comes to fulfilling vacancies for managers, directors, and chief officers; most companies are inclined to use services provided by head-hunting companies because these companies are specialized in seeking highly qualified workers with special tools, professional means.\n\nIn conclusion, I am convinced that there are more productive methods to recruit new personnel than interviews for the reasons mentioned above.

Why do you think this is happening? And how can we solve this problem?\n\nScore this IELTS Task 2 essay according to the rubric, ensuring alignment with the question:\n\nOne of the biggest problems facing all over the world today is that too much food is wasted. Some reasons that account for this trend can be identified, but there are some steps to be taken to change the situation. \r\n\r\n    Initially, there are various reasons why food is being wasted in manifold areas of the world. The first reason is that in developed countries people buy food items more than their needs.  For instance, in each meal, they cook a lot so that they are unable to eat it all, which makes food be leftover. Beside that reason, another factor is that people do not have preservation methods due to a lack of technology development especially in undeveloped countries. For example, in India it is not affordable to buy a fridge or freezer or use preservatives for their food, which can lead food to be easily perishable. \r\n\r\n     Despite some reasons mentioned above, there are several possible solutions that can be taken to mitigate this problem. Firstly, the government should raise awareness for citizens to buy and cook just enough to eat. They just have to buy and cook only for one meal to avoid wasting food and money. By contrast, in undeveloped countries, they should invest more money in farming, transportation and preservation methods. For example, they can receive sponsorship and investment from foreign countries to have modern technologies and improvements. As a consequence they can facilitate the traffic development to reduce the time to delivery, which might minimize the possibility of food spoiling. \r\n\r\n   Given the points raised above, wasted food is indeed a prevalent problem, but there are solutions that are relatively doable.

However, in today's, scenario it has been seen that women are proving their mettle even in traditionally male-dominated jobs. This essay shall delve into the reasons for this change.\r\n\r\nThe first and foremost reason is the opportunity today's women are getting. Nowadays, as more and more women in different countries have started working outside the home, it is clear that they are able to perform jobs that were traditionally only held by men. Secondly, today's woman is also going for higher education and because of this, even the highest positions in science, politics or law, for example, can be held successfully by women.\r\n\r\nAnother reason is that today anyone can be trained to do any type of job. There is also increasing scientific evidence that individual differences between people may be more important than gender differences. In other words, women may be physically stronger than some men, while some male individuals may be more sensitive, or more caring than some women.\r\n\r\nI believe that today societies are becoming more egalitarian. Earlier, women worked in the homes in most cultures. The girl child was even denied education in many places. Even if there were employed women, they tended to dominate the so-called caring professions such as teaching, nursing or social work. But today, men and women are walking shoulder to shoulder in every field and the line of demarcation between them has faded.\r\n\r\nTo sum up, in the modern world individual men and women can be trained to develop similar abilities.

My essay will outline a number of reasons for this trend and a number of its associated solutions.\n\nTo begin with, the increase in production of consumer products that harm the environment. When more goods are produced, more waste and toxic emissions are released from factories into nature. Water sources are polluted and air is seriously polluted, leading to harmful to humans and the death of many marine and terrestrial animals. For example, in Vietnam, when the Vinh Tan thermal power plant increased its electricity production, it caused extremely serious environmental pollution, affecting surrounding people, and columns of black smoke were continuously released. Therefore, leading to serious air pollution for surrounding people. Meanwhile, growing production of wares will consume a lot of materials. For instance, in a rural area of ​​China, a large number of trees are cut down in the forest to put into factories to produce house construction materials and tools. Consequently, This directly affects the ecological balance and habitat of many animal species.\n\nHowever, there are some possible solutions that can solve this problem. Firstly, companies should promote the use of more environmentally friendly materials. For example, coffee giant Starbucks recently replaced plastic straws with reusable alternatives made from materials such as paper or bamboo. Secondly, regulators need to enforce strict regulations on the consumer goods industry. For example, they can impose heavy fines on these manufacturing companies for littering or polluting the local environment, which can protect the local environment from being polluted by irresponsible behavior. of these companies.\n\nIn conclusion, although this trend has a negative impact on the environment, there are still some possible solutions to solve this problem.\n\nProvide your assessment in the specified JSON format."}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "{\"per_criterion\": [{\"name\": \"Task Response\", \"band\": 6.0, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"The growth in the manufacture of consumer goods leads to in destruction to the natural environment\", \"For instance, in a rural area of ​​China, a large number of trees are cut down in the forest to put into factories to produce house construction materials and tools\", \"In conclusion, although this trend has a negative impact on the environment, there are still some possible solutions to solve this problem\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"The growth in the manufacture of consumer goods leads to in destruction to the natural environment\", \"type\": \"task\", \"fix\": \"Consider improving the task response aspect here.\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Develop your main arguments more fully with specific examples.\", \"Ensure you address all parts of the question directly.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Coherence & Cohesion\", \"band\": 5.0, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"The growth in the manufacture of consumer goods leads to in destruction to the natural environment\", \"For instance, in a rural area of ​​China, a large number of trees are cut down in the forest to put into factories to produce house construction materials and tools\", \"In conclusion, although this trend has a negative impact on the environment, there are still some possible solutions to solve this problem\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"The growth in the manufacture of consumer goods leads to in destruction to the natural environment\", \"type\": \"coherence\", \"fix\": \"Consider improving the coherence & cohesion aspect here.\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Use more varied linking words to connect your ideas.\", \"Improve paragraph structure with clearer topic sentences.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Lexical Resource\", \"band\": 5.0, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"The growth in the manufacture of consumer goods leads to in destruction to the natural environment\", \"For instance, in a rural area of ​​China, a large number of trees are cut down in the forest to put into factories to produce house construction materials and tools\", \"In conclusion, although this trend has a negative impact on the environment, there are still some possible solutions to solve this problem\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"The growth in the manufacture of consumer goods leads to in destruction to the natural environment\", \"type\": \"lexical\", \"fix\": \"Consider improving the lexical resource aspect here.\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Use more sophisticated vocabulary and avoid repetition.\", \"Focus on precise word choice and natural collocations.\"]}, {\"name\": \"Grammatical Range & Accuracy\", \"band\": 6.0, \"evidence_quotes\": [\"The growth in the manufacture of consumer goods leads to in destruction to the natural environment\", \"For instance, in a rural area of ​​China, a large number of trees are cut down in the forest to put into factories to produce house construction materials and tools\", \"In conclusion, although this trend has a negative impact on the environment, there are still some possible solutions to solve this problem\"], \"errors\": [{\"span\": \"The growth in the manufacture of consumer goods leads to in destruction to the natural environment\", \"type\": \"grammar\", \"fix\": \"Consider improving the grammatical range & accuracy aspect here.\"}], \"suggestions\": [\"Use more complex sentence structures.\", \"Check for grammatical errors and improve accuracy.\"]}], \"overall\": 5.5, \"votes\": [5.5, 5.5, 5.5], \"dispersion\": 0.0, \"confidence\": \"high\", \"meta\": {\"prompt_hash\": \"training_data\", \"model\": \"training\", \"schema_version\": \"v1\", \"rubric_version\": \"rubric/v1\", \"token_usage\": {\"input_tokens\": 320, \"output_tokens\": 500}}}"}]}

While this thinking is valid to some extent, I would contend that astronomy is instrumental for society in this day of age.\n\nWithout a shadow of a doubt, space traveling plays a paramount significant role in addressing the earth crisis. With the explosion of population and an ever-increasing demand for a place to live, humans exacerbate environmental degradation by chopping down the forest for new buildings. Hence, imbalanced diversity, floods, earthquakes occur everywhere and are becoming more severe. By exploring space, people can have a firm grasp of university and other constellations which can allow people to settle in to tackle this alarming problem. Mar and moon exploration can be cited as a convincing and underlying example. Although those may not gain any fruitful achievements, they open humans to a new world where a new earth is a potential scenario.\n\nWhile the redeeming feature of space exploration is widely acknowledged, it is unfair if that of public services such as medical care is ignored. Evidently, the government’s investment in healthcare systems is of essence. In fact, a large number of people currently suffer from serious diseases due to criminally expensive prices of medical systems, thus, they may well be a burden to the community. Therefore, by cashing on the healthcare system to make it more affordable, people can enhance their health and be able to participate in the labour market, directly contributing to national prosperity.\n\nTo sum up, it is indisputable that space trails might positively impact on solving the environmental deterioration in quality.

What are the reasons for this? How can people research this?\n\nScore this IELTS Task 2 essay according to the rubric, ensuring alignment with the question:\n\nIt is often said that the number of individuals who wish to know more about the background story of their living places is rising in some countries. As a consequence, this occurrence has two reasons, and there is one way to help people in these regions to find out more about this matter. In the following essay, these are about to be debated as well.\r\n\r\nTo commence with, in many nations, the public tends to be more curious about the history of their accommodations than before since they want to prevent any unexpected incidents such as natural disasters in the future. By knowing the details about the past, they could anticipate any trouble that they would probably face in the future.  For instance, my father had acknowledged  the records of the occurrence of earthquakes in our place before. As a result, he constructed a highly protected area for emergency situations in our basement in order to protect ourselves. Additionally, they are looking forward to accommodating in a place that has an acceptable background because this could profit them financially if they wish to sell the house. Thus, it is probable that folk want to have know-how about the history of their places to be prepared for any emergency accident and make a profit.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, a certain way to get information about the background story of our buildings is to ask  local residents who have lived in the district for a long term. In this way, we have strong proof to rely on since these folks have witnessed various changes through time, and they have the most reliable information about the past of the entire neighbourhood. For example, my aunt was keen to know about the history of her house, and she asked one of her long-term neighbours about this topic. Consequently, she found out about the past of her living area more precisely than the internet. Although the internet has massive sources in terms of accommodation data, none of the data has been proven to be correct till now. Therefore, asking residents in the neighbourhood is the most convenient option compared with other ways of being informed.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, the number of people who are excited to figure out more about the past of their residences rockets in some regions. It seems that their ultimate aim is to have an anticipation of any unpredicted situation in order to prevent any detrimental accident.

People are discussing  the climate change more often than ever. Currently, the earth temperature is increasing by more than 3 degrees on an annual basis due to shifts in weather. To keep a check on this rapid temperature change, governments and organisations across the globe are putting in cummulative efforts. While this change has brought a concern to authorities, it has proven to be advantageous for many corporates in many business aspects.\r\n\r\nFirst and foremost,  this climate change has added an extra burden on the finances of many global companies. Many corporates have been increasing their amount of Corporate Social Responsibility(CSR) towards this climate change. For instance, in recent report by Financial Times, companies have increased their CSR index amount to an average of 3%, which was earlier 1%. Furthermore, this change has clearly disrupted the demand-supply chain for companies. As more and more people are concerned about the environment, they are shifting towards the usage of eco-friendly products. People are avoiding buying new automobiles, Air conditioners, Refrigerators nowadays and this is, in turn, has increased the supply more than its demand, which creates a loss for many companies. Clearly, climate change has shown a detrimental effect on many businesses.\r\n\r\nHowever, this adjustment has provided ample opportunities for many start-ups. Many communities are actively contributing to the cause to heal the planet. Many new start-ups have started businesses like manufacturing paper bags, cloth bags etc. These companies, by setting up the factories in rural areas, have created numerous job employment and hence, contributing towards the economy of the nation. Therefore, for many new but small corporates, this climate change is the best bet to save the planet and increase their business turnover.\r\n\r\nTo conclude,  climate transition has abrupted many businesses but has created  awareness among people to save  mankind.
