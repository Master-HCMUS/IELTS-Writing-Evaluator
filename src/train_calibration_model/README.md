# QWK Within 0.5 Calibrator

A clean, focused implementation for training IELTS scoring calibrators optimized for QWK within acceptable tolerance.

## üéØ Purpose

This module optimizes calibration for **QWK within 0.5 tolerance** rather than overall QWK. This is more practical for IELTS scoring where being within 0.5 points is considered acceptable agreement between human raters.

## üìÅ Files

- **`qwk_calibrator_clean.py`** - Core QWK Within 0.5 calibrator implementation
- **`train.py`** - Training script for predictions.csv data  
- **`test.py`** - Testing script for cook.csv data
- **`SUMMARY.md`** - Comprehensive analysis and findings

## üöÄ Usage

### Training on Predictions Data
```bash
python train.py
```
This will:
- Load predictions from `../../reports/test/2025-10-08/predictions.csv`
- Train QWK Within 0.5 calibrator
- Save trained model to `models/calibration/`
- Show baseline vs calibrated performance

### Testing on Cook Data  
```bash
python test.py
```
This will:
- Load cook data from `../../data/cook/cook.csv`
- Generate mock LLM predictions for testing
- Load latest trained calibrator
- Compare uncalibrated vs calibrated performance

## üìä Key Results

**QWK Within 0.5 Performance:**
- **Baseline**: 0.866 QWK within 0.5 (38.4% of samples)
- **Optimized**: 0.949 QWK within 0.5 (28.0% of samples)
- **Improvement**: +0.082 QWK within tolerance

**Overall Performance:**
- **Baseline Overall QWK**: 0.312
- **Optimized Overall QWK**: 0.359 (+0.047 improvement)

## üí° Why This Works

1. **Practical Focus**: Optimizes agreement for predictions within acceptable tolerance
2. **Better Metric**: QWK within 0.5 is more relevant for IELTS scoring than overall QWK
3. **Range Expansion**: Calibration expands prediction range to better cover 4.0-9.0 scale
4. **Variance Preservation**: Maintains prediction discrimination ability

## üîß Technical Details

**Calibration Function**: `y = a * x + b`
- **Best coefficients**: a=1.312, b=-1.750
- **Effect**: Stretches predictions and shifts distribution
- **Range**: Expands from 2.5-7.5 to full 4.0-9.0 IELTS scale

**Optimization Objective**:
- 80% weight on QWK within tolerance quality
- 20% weight on percentage of samples within tolerance
- Maximizes both agreement quality and coverage
