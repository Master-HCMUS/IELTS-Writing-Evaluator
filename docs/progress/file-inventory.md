Change Log
- [2025-08-15 09:00Z] Editor: Copilot
  - files: pyproject.toml, .gitignore, .env.example, src/app/__init__.py, src/app/config.py, src/app/main.py, src/app/versioning/determinism.py, schemas/score_request.v1.json, schemas/score_response.v1.json, schemas/facts_task1.v1.json, tests/test_prompt_hash.py, docs/progress/plan-order-and-progress.md, docs/progress/file-inventory.md
  - summary: Initialize Phase 0 scaffolding with pinned deps, schemas v1, determinism utilities, FastAPI skeleton, and unit test; update tracker and add file inventory.
  - notes: FND-1 and FND-2 set to In progress; next add validation wiring and run metadata capture in API responses.
- [2025-08-15 09:30Z] Editor: Copilot
  - files: pyproject.toml, src/app/validation/__init__.py, src/app/validation/schemas.py, tests/test_schema_validation.py, docs/progress/plan-order-and-progress.md, docs/progress/file-inventory.md
  - summary: Completed Phase 0 by adding JSON Schema validation utilities and tests; configured pytest to import src; marked Phase 0 complete in tracker.
  - notes: Next Phase 1 â€” implement /score (Task 2) with 3-pass adjudication and logging.
- [2025-08-15 10:00Z] Editor: Copilot
  - files: src/app/scoring/__init__.py, src/app/scoring/aggregate.py, src/app/scoring/task2_stub.py, src/app/main.py, tests/test_aggregate.py, tests/test_score_endpoint.py, docs/progress/plan-order-and-progress.md, docs/progress/file-inventory.md
  - summary: Implemented Phase 1 minimal /score (Task 2) with deterministic 3-pass aggregation and schema validation; added tests.
  - notes: Next: wire real LLM scorer, add storage/logging and baseline telemetry (LOG-1, OBS-1).
- [2025-08-15 10:30Z] Editor: Copilot
  - files: src/app/main.py, docs/progress/plan-order-and-progress.md, docs/progress/file-inventory.md
  - summary: Added latency middleware, local run logging (runs/{date}/{run_id}), prompt_hash computation, and max word guardrail for Task 2.
  - notes: Phase 1 continues; next wire basic metrics export and start Azure storage integration (optional).
- [2025-08-15 11:00Z] Editor: Copilot
  - files: src/app/scoring/aggregate.py, src/app/main.py, tests/test_aggregate.py, docs/progress/plan-order-and-progress.md, docs/progress/file-inventory.md
  - summary: Implemented per-criterion median aggregation and wired it into /score; added unit test.
  - notes: Phase 1 next steps: wire basic metrics export and consider simple language detection pre-check.

  - files: pyproject.toml, src/app/prompts/__init__.py, src/app/prompts/task2.py, src/app/scoring/llm_client.py, src/app/main.py, test_local.py, docs/progress/plan-order-and-progress.md, docs/progress/file-inventory.md
  - summary: Integrated LLM scoring for Task 2 with Azure OpenAI client and mock mode for local testing; added prompts with rubric integration.
  - notes: Task 2 now runnable locally without Azure credentials (uses mock mode); with credentials, calls Azure OpenAI.

  - files: docs/plan/evaluation/README.md, docs/plan/evaluation/scope-and-dataset.md, docs/plan/evaluation/design-and-files.md, docs/plan/evaluation/metrics-and-report.md, docs/plan/evaluation/runbook.md, docs/plan/evaluation/progress-tracker.md
  - summary: Added evaluation plan docs and updated to use the test split for evaluation; documented run steps and metrics.
  - notes: Evaluate 1,000 samples from the test split by default; artifacts go to reports/eval/.
   - [2025-08-17 08:10Z] Editor: Copilot
    - files: docs/plan/evaluation/scope-and-dataset.md, docs/plan/evaluation/runbook.md, docs/plan/evaluation/metrics-and-report.md
    - summary: Updated plan to use all available test records (~491) by default and adjusted runbook commands accordingly.
    - notes: Runner should treat --num-samples as optional; default is full test split.
     - [2025-08-17 08:20Z] Editor: Copilot
      - files: docs/plan/evaluation/design-and-files.md
      - summary: Clarified that the FastAPI /score endpoint will use the reusable scorer pipeline to keep a single source of truth.
      - notes: Avoids duplication and keeps evaluation runner and API behavior aligned.
