"Fresh water has always been a limited resource in some parts of the world. Today, however, growing worldwide demand has made this a global problem.

What are the causes of the increased demand and what measure could governments and individuals take to respond to this problem?

Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.","Since time immemorial, in certain drier parts of the world, fresh water has always been a scarce natural resource. However, in the present time, due to various reasons, scarcity of fresh water has become a global issue. This essay will illustrate some factors contributing to this problem and will also elicit certain steps that can help the national authorities and individuals in controlling this growing demand for natural salt free water.

Firstly, population explosion is the factor of utmost importance, which has lead to the global surge in potable water requirement. Secondly, increased pollution of natural fresh water reserves due to urbanisation and industrialization has compounded this demand. Furthermore, in modern times, the growing use of salt free water for activities like recreational swimming, have also catalysed the surge in global water demand.

National authorities, on the other hand, can control this surge by implementing public education schemes regarding controlled water usage. Strict national legislations for preventing natural fresh water reserve pollution are also required. Moreover, government should also enact infrastructures for purification of seawater into saline free water, which will help in meeting the growing requirement of fresh water.

Similarly, public can also contribute towards this noble cause by conserving water and also by limiting their daily household water usage. They should refrain themselves from performing activities that will pollute natural fresh water reserves.

Thus even though, the scarcity of fresh water is a growing global problem, there are various means and methods available, by which both the government and individuals can prevent this from worsening. ",9,9,9,9,9
"Forests are the lungs of the earth. Destruction of the world’s forests amounts to death of the world we currently know.

To what extent do you agree or disagree?","I am in consummate accord with the statement that, the Earth’s natural green reserves purify its atmosphere and functions synonymously as that of the mammalian lungs. I also advocate the view that, forest destruction will ruin our present world.

Firstly, from our basic knowledge of plant physiology, it can be restated that, plants by the process of photosynthesis convert the harmful carbon-dioxide gas into Oxygen, without which life cannot exist.  Thus in a wider perspective, it can be stated that, the earth’s forests purify the atmosphere and thereby help in sustaining life. Secondly, environmentalists have proven that, the rapid destruction of forests is also a leading cause of global warming. Hence, destruction of the natural green reserves may lead to such a surge in the global temperature that agricultural land may become arid, leading to wide spread famine and deaths. Thirdly, forests also house diverse forms of life and these would become extinct if we continue to destroy their natural habitats.

Furthermore, scientific research have proven that forest ecosystem act as natural scavengers and by the process of biodegradation, forest ecology helps in producing crude oil, which fuels our modern world and its unavailability is unimaginable as this will directly catalyse a global economic crisis. Finally forests are also source of numerous medicinal plants, from which varieties of modern medicines are produced; Quinine, an antimalarial drug, produced from the barks of Cinchona trees is the best possible example. Hence forest destruction will also be a bane for the medical community.

Thus the harmony of the present wonderful will be ruined if our natural green reserves are continuously destroyed and there is a theoretical possibility that the blue planet might become lifeless if these green lungs are totally wiped out.",9,9,9,9,9
"The most important thing about a job is how much money you earn in that job.

Do you agree or disagree?","A vast majority of our adult life is spent working; hence it is important that we have an appropriate job that fulfils our aspirations. While financial remuneration is an important factor that attracts individuals towards a specific work, there are other factors of equal significance that make a job ideal.

Firstly, the importance of financial security cannot be undermined in the modern materialistic world. Since a vast majority of people earn their livelihood from their workplace, it will be difficult for individuals with single source of income, to make their ends meet, from underpaying jobs. Thus underpaid employees, because of their financial burdens, may not be able to offer dedication and commitment at workplace, which in turn results in under-performance. Secondly, the educated refrain from being employed in underpaying jobs, as these are less attractive. Hence the remuneration associated, is an important factor that determines the value of a particular job.

On the other hand, to glorify higher earning as the sole determiner of an ideal job is incorrect. This is because various other factors like work and life balance; working place culture and adequate recognition contribute towards satisfaction and contentment in work. Thus an astronomically higher paying job with a demanding employer, with poor social life in a tedious work place environment will lead to higher job dissatisfaction, which in turn will also promote higher attrition.

Henceforth, it can be stated that apart from financial remuneration, which is a major determiner of a good occupation, job satisfaction is also an equally important associated factor that determines the value of a specific job.",9,9,9,9,9
"Some people believe the aim of university education is to help graduates get better jobs. Others believe there are much wider benefits of university education for both individuals and society.

Discuss both views and give your opinion.","University education, even though is definitely directed towards generating lucrative employment opportunities for the advanced students; there are additional arrays of associated benefits of tertiary education that are worth mentioning.

Firstly market researches in the United States and other developed countries have shown that post graduates are able to command a considerable higher salary at workplace when compared to graduates or simple high school diploma holders. Moreover, the professional world of certain white collared highly respected professions, like those of physicians, engineers, scientists can only be pursued, after graduating from the respective university courses. Furthermore, in certain fields like management, the credibility of various universities are judged by their ability to generate glittering well-paid employment offers for their fresh graduates, during their campus placements. Hence university education is definitely perceived as a means of better employability.

In this context it is worth mentioning that, apart from generating lucrative jobs for students, universities also benefit the nation by creating educated societies, containing an immense pool of forward thinking individuals, who can contribute towards social development by their respective expertise. Individuals graduating from universities also additionally benefit from the multicultural environments that promote intercultural tolerance and brotherhood. The process of tertiary education also promotes teamwork and collective development amongst individuals. Over and above, numerous long lasting friendships, business partnerships and courtships also bloom from the university campus life.

Finally, to sum up, it can be confidently stated that apart from generating respectable employment, there are numerous associated positive aspects of university education, which are of great social and individual significance.",9,9,9,9,9
"International tourism has brought enormous benefit to many places. At the same time, there is concern about its impact on local inhabitants and the environment.

Do the disadvantages of international tourism outweigh the advantages?","Travel industry has experienced a major boom in the later part of the 20th century and has been a boon in disguise, which has helped some weaker nations to uplift their failing economies. While questions have been raised regarding the negative impacts that accompany the growth in the travel sector, these definitely do not outweigh the associated benefits.

The economic boost that accompanies a successful travel industry is quite well recognised and Thailand is the best example. The entire Thai economy revolves around tourism and the country had been able to uplift its socio economic status through its flourishing hospitality sector.  Egypt is another nation that is heavily dependent on its hospitality sector. The growth in the number of incoming tourists leads to innumerable prospects in terms of local entrepreneurship & employment generation. This is also associated with international investments and infrastructure development. The national authorities, in order to ensure safety of the international visitors provide better law and order enforcement, improved transportation and healthcare facilities, which in turn benefit the local population.

On the other hand, the rising influx of holidaymakers is associated with increased incidences of crimes, prostitution and antisocial activities like drugs, human trafficking and gambling, which affect the values of the indigenous society. The local population are also affected by the growth in property value indices. Environmentalists are also concerned regarding environmental remodelling, that is associated with increased tourist activities in natural reserves. In this context, it is worth mentioning that, by enforcing stern law and order and implementing strict legislations, governments can control most of these negative impacts of tourism.

Henceforth, it can be confidently conveyed that, even though the growth in travel industry has accompanying negative social impacts, these do not outweigh the contributions made by this sector towards social development.",9,9,9,9,9
"In the modern world, the image (photograph or film) is becoming a more powerful way of communicating than the written word.

To what extent do you agree or disagree?","In modern society, with the advent of advanced telecommunication and photographic technologies, visual expression in mediums such as television, photography and films are increasingly becoming popular as powerful means of expression when compared to the simple mundane printed medium.

The increasing preference and use of visual resources over written communication is an undeniable fact and the growing utilisation of video based learning in modern schools over text book based knowledge transfer is the best possible example. In the present evidence-seeking world, visual communication is a powerful tool as it provides recognisable facts. Meticulously crafted images, like political cartoons and television documentaries readily deliver the concerned messages to the onlookers and are mostly beneficial in conveying thoughts to the busy and uneducated sections of the society. The television is also being bombarded with numerous catchy advertisements, by which manufacturers try to communicate with the masses regarding their products.

On the other hand, the appeal of the printed media as means of mass communication, is declining as the younger generation considers it to be relatively old fashioned and boring. Moreover, in the fast paced modern city life, less number of people can afford to dedicate time for reading the daily morning newsprints, instead, most of the city dwellers follow daily-televised news. Despite this decreased appeal for mass communication, value of the written form still stands tall in the field of interpersonal and formal communication. Written words, as a form of official documentation, can never be superseded by any other means.

Thus, visual communication is definitely a popular, powerful and better tool for mass communication but written form of expression still has equal importance for official, formal and interpersonal purposes.

"In some countries young people are encouraged to work or travel for a year between finishing high school and starting university studies.

Discuss the advantages and disadvantages for young people who decide to do this.","In certain countries, it is preferred that students should take a year off from studies after completing high school, prior to joining universities and during this period they are encouraged to work or to travel. Even though this seems to be a noble concept, it has its own merits and demerits and some of these will be illustrated in this essay.

Firstly, a year off, after completing years of continuous school education is a welcome break for students and is well deserved too. This period also serves as well earned family time for those pupils who grew up within the closed boundaries of boarding schools. Secondly, this period provides ample opportunities to young people, to experience the realities of the modern world. Those students who prefer a break, can experiment with various forms of employment and thereby decide their career goals and directions depending upon their experiences. The holidaymakers, on the other hand can familiarise with the customs and cultures of various countries, which in turn will widen their outlook and will also promote cultural tolerance. Thus, in a wider perspective, such breaks help the young minds in preparing for the much demanding university life.

In contrast, certain disadvantages are definitely associated with this concept and are worth mentioning. Firstly, scholars are of the opinion that, such breaks from studies, during the learning phase of life, affects further education. According to them, such activities should not be encouraged as there are higher chances that the young minds might loose interest in learning or may get demotivated due to various reasons and might ultimately refrain from pursuing university education. Secondly, the employed youth, due to a sudden increase in their purchasing power, might also get attracted to various social evils like drugs, gambling and alcoholism.

Thus to sum up, it will be wise to comment that such policies even though are noble practices, should not be made mandatory in a national scale, as these activities are also associated with considerable negative outcome.

"The money spent by the governments on space programmes would be better spent on vital public services such as schools and hospitals. To what extent do you agree or disagree?
","In recent years, governments around the world have invested heavily in astronomical missions. While these programmes may lead to technological breakthroughs and international prestige, I firmly believe that public money should be prioritised for essential sectors like schooling and medical care. These sectors have a far more immediate and meaningful impact on citizens’ well-being.

One strong reason to support the redirection of interplanetary budgets is that schools and hospitals form the foundation of any functional society. Spending billions on extraterrestrial expeditions diverts crucial funds away from basic public soft infrastructure including education and public health. Education empowers future generations with knowledge and skills and healthcare ensures a healthy population capable of contributing to the economy. Without sufficient investment in these areas, a country risks stagnation in human development. For instance, in many low-income nations, children still study in overcrowded classrooms with few qualified teachers. According to UNESCO, improving school infrastructure and teacher training can significantly increase literacy and employment outcomes. Clearly, this kind of investment delivers immediate and long-term benefits that space programmes cannot match.

Another argument is that astronomical missions rarely address the urgent needs of the general public. Even though space explorations may offer scientific knowledge, they do not solve pressing issues such as illness, poverty, or unequal access to schooling. The majority of citizens are more concerned with access to affordable healthcare and quality schooling than with planetary exploration. Prioritising these basic provisions ensures that resources are directed toward problems that affect millions of people on a daily basis. A good example is Cuba, which has invested consistently in its public health system. Despite economic limitations, the country boasts high life expectancy and low infant mortality rates—results achieved not through advanced technology, but through consistent support for medical care. Redirecting interplanetary programme budgets could allow other nations to replicate the success.

In conclusion, although astronomical missions have their intellectual and technological merits, I strongly believe that public funds are better spent on education and medical care. These foundational pillars address the core needs of society and produce immediate, measurable improvements in people’s lives. Governments should therefore prioritise the well-being of their citizens over distant, uncertain discoveries.",8.5,8,7.0,9,9
"news editors decide what to broadcast on television and what to print in newspapers. what factors do you think influence these decisions? do we become used to bad news? would it be better if more good news was reported?
","Media outlets often find themselves in turmoil in choosing issues to present to the public. Although they consider a lot of aspects, bad accounts are usually more common to find rather than pleasant ones. This leads people to argue that a good narrative  must be delivered, or perhaps even more reported.

In detail, editors take into account various features that guarantee the audience's interest. News should have prominence, meaning consumers need to recognize the subject such as celebrities. It additionally needs to have timeliness which translates to being updated. Lastly, it must be significant, in other words, important to society. Moreover, these qualities make an event likely appealing to the public and are highly considered in decision-making regarding headlines.

While both types of narratives meet the aforementioned characteristics, editors commonly take advantage of the psychological habit of people to dwell on despicable stories or gossip. For instance, media coverage of Donald Trump's previous crime allegations during the United States elections completely overshadowed his past political achievements. Furthermore, studies show there is a human tendency to react more strongly to negative information in contrast to positive ones which subsequently leads to anxiety or mood disorders.

Nevertheless, according to another study, gratifying stories have been shown to boost dopamine levels which consequently improves mood as well as decreases depression.Therefore, it would be better to increase the number of uplifting broadcasts such as Carlos Yulo's double gold victory during the Paris Olympics which certainly makes individuals feel more elated, inspired and relieved. This is undoubtedly more beneficial than fixating on depressing topics that likely affect a person's mental well-being.

In summary, news that is intriguing, timebound and relevant highly influences broadcasting. Correspondingly, these requirements are similarly met by both horrid and optimistic journals. Unfortunately, these factors are more utilized by negative controversy due to the likelihood that people’s curiosity is more drawn by horrible events despite their psychological impacts. Despite that, mood-lightening reports should be aired more to redirect the public’s focus to healthy journalism consumption rather than a toxic one which is proportional to  optimal psychological health.

"Some people think that getting a degree from univerity is the best way to secure a good job. Others believe that employers value work experience more than a university degree. Discuss both views and give your opinion. Angsa
","It is argued that  gaining a university degree ensures  job opportunities, while others say that  work experience is more crucial to being employed. While the professional experience develops practical skills, I believe that the education provided by institutions allows us to implement deeper approaches to the subject.

On the one hand, learning skills in real life enhances the ability to do the job. Not only do apprentices acquire  essential lessons through  experimental practices with their trainers, but they also acquire the techniques of helpful methods to offer products to the public. Furthermore, it shortens the duration of the educational process and prepares labourers for the society. For example, provided statistics by Nazarbayev University show that 67% of effective employees in the vast majority of countries are those individuals, who developed their skillfulness through training in their fields.

On the other hand, what makes employers seek  graduates is their well-rounded knowledge imparted by the university. If humans are aware of all the aspects of their work, they can identify  emerging problems more easily and create important breakthroughs in their spheres. Moreover,  innovative advancements can be achieved in the case of the employment of professionals. For instance, according to a study conducted by the Ministry of Labour and Employment of Kazakhstan, 78% of experts in various fields are employed in positions related to their degrees.

In conclusion, though gaining awareness in practical labour is beneficial for becoming competent, I think that graduating from institutions with versatile education is the key to building a successful career for the majority of people.

"It is sometimes possible to pay somebody to do things you don't want to do, or don't have time to do, for example, household chores or looking after children. Is this a good way of providing work for others? Should people do these things themselves? Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.
","There is no denying that hiring someone to complete tasks can be highly beneficial for individuals and society as a whole. This essay will explore whether this practice provides job opportunities for others and whether people should manage these responsibilities themselves.

Firstly, many individuals today lead extremely busy lives, which often necessitates seeking assistance with household chores and childcare. After a long day at work, it’s common for people to feel overwhelmed by their responsibilities at home, making the option of hiring help increasingly appealing. This situation can create a substantial demand for workers in various sectors, such as cleaning and caregiving, ultimately boosting the job market. For instance, in many affluent countries, there is a reliance on workers from developing nations who provide essential services. This not only contributes to economic growth but also fosters cultural exchange and understanding among diverse communities.

On the other hand, I believe it is perfectly acceptable for individuals to delegate these tasks, especially if they possess the financial means to do so. Outsourcing chores enables people to reclaim valuable time, allowing them to focus on their careers, pursue personal interests, or spend quality time with family. Furthermore, this arrangement creates employment opportunities for those willing to work, helping them achieve financial independence. Thus, it fosters a mutually advantageous situation where both parties can benefit.

In conclusion, while opinions may vary regarding this issue, I strongly contend that hiring help can lead to significant benefits for everyone involved. It creates job opportunities while enhancing the quality of life for those who choose to seek assistance with their daily responsibilities.

"Companies invest millions of dollars in advertising to persuade consumers to buy their products. Do the advantages of this outweigh the disadvantages for the consumer?
","Organisations worldwide spend a huge sum of money on the promotion of their products to make customers buy them. Although ads inform about good-quality items, their frequent appearance can be distracting to purchasers.

On the one hand, people can become acknowledged of a high-quality product because of advertising tools. Not only do commercials offer humans better options of items they need, but they also influence consumers by providing an opportunity to learn more about new contemporary items, which promotes purchasers' standards of living by gaining stuff that facilitates their daily duties. For example, provided statistics by Nazarbayev University show that 78% of annual purchases, such as devices, clothes and food products, are made only after consumers see advertisements.

On the other hand, excessive advertisements may be considered  intrusive and distractive interference in the daily lives of viewers. Furthermore, if ads appear too frequently to the majority, they might create a negative impression and lead to a loss of trust in potential customers, instead of gaining a good reputation in front of them. For instance, according to the survey conducted by the Worldwide Marketing Researchers Institute, the average frequency of commercial appearances, which leads to  sales, is three times per week. However, the vast majority of marketing managers have exceeded this number, creating  chaos by showing ads more than 7 times per week, which results in customers' disapproval.

In conclusion, while commercials provide people with information about  beneficial manufactured goods, excessive appearances can be problematic for them. Therefore, the disadvantages for consumers outweigh the advantages of advertisements for many individuals.

"Some people think that economic growth is the most important goal for a country, while others believe that other types of progress, such as social or environmental development, are equally important. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.
","Economic growth is often regarded as the most significant goal for a nation, as it generates wealth, raises living standards, and provides funding for public services. However, others argue that social and environmental progress should be given equal priority because prosperity alone cannot ensure long-term well-being. This essay will discuss both perspectives before presenting my own view.

On the one hand, supporters of prioritising economic growth point out that a strong economy creates a solid foundation for national development. Higher GDP enables governments to invest more in healthcare, education, and infrastructure, which directly improve citizens’ quality of life. Moreover, economic growth attracts foreign investment and generates employment, reducing poverty and social inequality. For example, many Asian countries that have focused on rapid industrialisation have significantly improved living conditions for millions of people.

On the other hand, critics argue that focusing solely on economic performance can lead to serious social and environmental issues. Rapid industrialisation often comes at the expense of environmental degradation, such as air pollution, deforestation, and climate change. Furthermore, if income distribution is ignored, growth may benefit only a small elite, leaving the majority of the population disadvantaged. In this sense, social equality, healthcare, education, and environmental protection are equally crucial indicators of true progress. Without them, economic prosperity may prove unsustainable.

In my opinion, while economic development is undeniably important, it should not be the sole priority. A balanced approach that combines financial strength with social justice and environmental sustainability is essential for long-term stability. Countries that pursue growth at the expense of society or nature may achieve short-term gains but risk facing severe consequences in the future.

In conclusion, although economic growth plays a pivotal role in national progress, it should go hand in hand with social and environmental development. Only by achieving balance among these goals can nations secure sustainable prosperity for future generations.",8,8,8,7,8
"Some argue that economic progress and environmental sustainability are mutually exclusive. Discuss both viewpoints and express your opinion.
","In recent years, the question of whether countries should choose between economic growth and environmental sustainability has been widely debated. Whilst some contend that the two can coexist, others believe that they are incompatible. This essay will discuss both perspectives and explain why I support the former viewpoint.

On the one hand, I agree with those who advocate that countries can ensure economic prosperity while preserving the environment. Governments can invest in eco-friendly infrastructure, including electric vehicles, renewable energy, and recycling centres, to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and thus protect ecosystems in the long term. As a result, when people can enjoy clean air that maintains their well-being with well-maintained green spaces, it can promote eco-tourism and boost economic growth. For example, even though Singapore has invested heavily in sustainable infrastructure, where it has developed public transportation systems and recyclable products, it ranks among the top ten strongest economies.

On the other hand, opponents argue that achieving economic prosperity and preserving the environment simultaneously is a conflicting goal. They point out that rapid economic growth comes at the expense of the environment, as industrialisation can strengthen the economy and lift millions of citizens out of poverty; however, it releases an immense amount of carbon dioxide emissions into the atmosphere. For instance, China has built thousands of factories and power plants, which have successfully raised countless residents above the poverty line. Nevertheless, this swift industrial development led to severe smog, deteriorating overall public health.

To conclude, although rapid industrialisation might seem the most effective method for strengthening the economy, I am convinced that investing in clean environments can not only create a prosperous nation but also preserve the planet for future generations.",8,6,7,9,9
"There are more workers work from home ad more students studying from home. This is because computer technology is more and more accessible and cheaper. Do you think it is a positive or negative development?
","In recent years, technology has transformed the way people work. Whilst some argue that it has certain drawbacks, I firmly believe that it is a highly positive trend and will explain my opinion.

To begin with, advancements in technology have made it possible for people to study or work remotely, resulting in savings of both time and money. Remote employees and students have the ability to complete their tasks from home, which provides greater flexibility and saves time that otherwise would be wasted on commuting. For example, a 2022 study in the United States found that 67% of residents chose telecommuting over on-site work because they were stressed about traffic congestion. Moreover, since online learners and teleworkers do not need to pay for fossil fuels in order to arrive at their workplaces, they can save a large amount of money and help preserve the environment.

Furthermore, both online learning and businesses ensure accessibility for a large population. Every student can access online courses that are free of charge, which provides opportunities for disadvantaged individuals, including rural dwellers, disabled groups, and elderly adults, to learn and improve despite the barriers present in traditional learning. Similarly, citizens who live in a developing country can find high-paying jobs that match their qualifications in a developed nation. For instance, statistics from 2020 in Saudi Arabia reported that 21% of citizens were home-based workers, with salaries that exceeded twenty thousand.

To conclude, although remote working and studying may have some challenges, I am convinced that their advantages far outweigh their disadvantages. Thanks to technology, teleworking and online learning now offer wider accessibility and are more time-efficient and affordable.",8,7,7,9,9
"Some people believe that technology is making people more socially isolated, while others think it is helping people connect. Discuss both views and give your opinion.
","In recent years, technology has transformed the way people communicate. While some argue that digital tools have made socialising easier and frequent, others claim that they have reduced individuals' social skills. This essay will discuss both perspectives and explain why I support the former viewpoint.

On the one hand, I agree with those who advocate that the internet has made people more social than ever before. The advances in technology have produced numerous tools, including instant messaging apps, video call applications, and social networking platforms, all of which encourage individuals to socialise more. For example, most migrants depend on this development to keep in touch with their distant relatives, which was impossible a few decades ago. Moreover, the internet can help individuals with specific needs, such as patients with a rare condition, groups with a terminal cancer, or even the elderly, by providing access to connect and support each other, which is considered an advantage that cannot be easily achieved in real life.

On the other hand, opponents argue that technological programs are making people solitary. They point out that online platforms lack face-to-face interactions, which makes conversations less meaningful. From their perspective, many youths prefer spending time on social media and playing online games rather than meeting friends in person, which can ultimately deteriorate in-depth personal relationships. For instance, a 2020 study in the United States found that 33% of residents were addicted to social media applications, leading to an increase in the risks of feeling anxiety, depression, and loneliness. However, these problems can only occur as a result of the irresponsible use of digital online technologies.

To conclude, although there are certain social consequences of using tech tools carelessly, I am convinced that they are more effective in bringing people together.",8,7,7,8,9
"Some people think that a sense of competition in children should be encouraged. Others believe that children who are taught to co-operate rather than compete become more useful adults. Discuss both these views and give your own opinion. Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.
","Life inevitably presents individuals with adverse circumstances, whether these involve dissatisfaction at work or financial hardship. Some argue that people should simply accept such conditions, while others believe that determination and self-discipline can enable improvement. In my view, although acceptance may occasionally be unavoidable, striving to change one’s situation is usually the more empowering and productive response.

One perspective is that individuals sometimes have no option but to accept their reality. For example, in many developing nations, university graduates are forced to work in low-paid factories because widespread corruption and economic instability restrict social mobility. Even when these individuals possess the necessary skills and ambition, structural barriers prevent them from pursuing better opportunities. This proves that external systems, rather than personal effort, can decide outcomes. Consequently, acceptance may represent the most practical strategy when circumstances are shaped by factors beyond personal control.

In contrast, it is often argued that adversity can be overcome through resilience and the right mindset. A clear example is Jack Ma, who began his career as a poorly paid English teacher in China before establishing Alibaba, one of the world’s largest e-commerce companies. His success illustrates that perseverance, consistency, and vision can transform hardship into opportunity. This shows that personal qualities often play a larger role than background conditions in determining success. Thus, self-improvement is frequently attainable, provided that individuals cultivate determination and adaptability.

In conclusion, while there are cases where acceptance of hardship is unavoidable, the greater value lies in striving for improvement. By demonstrating discipline, resilience, and self-belief, people can overcome obstacles and reshape their futures. In my opinion, individuals should always attempt to enhance their circumstances, since only through effort can genuine progress be achieved.",8,8,7,8,9
"People spend more and more time browsing social networks. Is it a positive or negative development? Should anything be done to restrict children’s access to social networks? Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.
","The two still-life paintings by Paul Cézanne and Maurice de Vlaminck represent contrasting approaches to art, despite focusing on similar subject matter. While both artists explored the genre of still life, their styles reveal two distinct artistic movements that shaped modern art history.

Overall, Cézanne’s Still Life with Fruit demonstrates features of late Impressionism, whereas Vlaminck’s Still Life with Bottles embodies Fauvism, a radical style that was controversial in its time. These works highlight the shift in European art during the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, when painters sought to challenge the dominance of classical traditions and redefine aesthetic values.

Cézanne’s painting is characterised by visible yet controlled brushstrokes, an open composition, and careful attention to the play of light. The shading is fully developed, capturing subtle tonal variations that create depth and emphasise realism. Such qualities reflect the Impressionist concern with depicting natural light and atmosphere as accurately as possible. In contrast, Vlaminck rejected these conventions in pursuit of expressive freedom. His bottle composition shows incomplete and flat shadows with no smooth gradient, while the perspective of the objects appears inconsistent, as if intentionally distorted. As a result, the ceramic pieces resemble paper cut-outs decorated with patterns, whereas the glass bottles retain more conventional form.

Another notable difference lies in the treatment of colour. Cézanne employed a soft palette and a pale background, which enhanced the natural appearance of the fruit and interior space. Vlaminck, however, relied on high vibrancy, sharp contrasts, and strong lighting with little transition between tones. This bold use of colour is a hallmark of Fauvism, where expressive intensity was valued above representational accuracy.

In conclusion, although Cézanne and Vlaminck both painted still-life subjects, their works illustrate the fundamental divide between Impressionism and Fauvism.Together, these paintings demonstrate the diversity of artistic responses during a transformative period in European art

"Some people think that men and women hav different qualities, therefore certain jobs are suitable for meen and others for women. To what extent do you agree or disagree?
","In contemporary society, gender equality has become a central discussion point, particularly regarding employment opportunities. While it is true that men and women may differ in certain biological or psychological aspects, I strongly disagree with the notion that specific jobs should be reserved for one gender. Instead, I believe that suitability for a job depends more on individual ability and training than on gender differences.

Admittedly, men and women are not identical in physical attributes. For example, men generally possess greater muscle mass, which may provide an advantage in physically demanding roles such as heavy construction or firefighting. However, technological advancements and improved workplace practices have significantly reduced the need for sheer physical strength. Modern equipment, safety protocols, and collaborative work environments enable women to perform these jobs effectively, as demonstrated by the growing number of female soldiers, engineers, and first responders.

Beyond physical strength, the assumption that men are inherently more logical or that women are naturally more emotional oversimplifies human capabilities. Many studies suggest that both genders can excel in fields requiring analytical reasoning, creativity, or emotional intelligence, depending on education and personal temperament. For instance, women have proven themselves as successful leaders and executives, while men have thrived in professions traditionally associated with empathy and care, such as nursing and teaching. These examples highlight that qualities are not determined by gender but shaped by experience and opportunity.

In conclusion, although men and women may exhibit some natural differences, restricting jobs based on gender is neither fair nor practical. In the modern workforce, individual talent, training, and motivation are far more important than biological distinctions. Therefore, all people should be encouraged to pursue careers aligned with their skills and interests, regardless of gender.",7.5,7,6,7,9
"The family has a great influence on children development but the influence from outside the home play bigger part in children's likes. do you agree or disagree
","It is often argued that children are shaped not only by their families but also by wider social influences. In my view, both factors play crucial roles, but their impact may be stronger at different stages of a child’s life.

To begin with, the family provides the first and most lasting influence on children’s development. Parents act as role models, and youngsters usually adopt their attitudes, values, and manners through daily interaction at home. For example, respect for others or a strong work ethic is usually instilled by parents long before children enter school. In addition, a supportive family environment gives children emotional security and confidence, which are essential for healthy growth. Without this foundation, many children struggle to form stable relationships or cope with difficulties later in life.

On the other hand, external influences become increasingly significant as children grow older. One powerful factor is peer groups. Friends often shape children’s likes and dislikes, from the music they listen to, to the clothes they wear, and even the decisions they make about study or leisure. Another key influence is the media, including social networks, films, and advertisements. These channels create powerful images of success and lifestyle, which children may try to imitate, sometimes even more eagerly than following parental guidance.

In conclusion, the family plays an essential role in providing values and emotional stability, while outside influences such as peers and media strongly affect children’s interests and choices. Therefore, I believe both sources of influence are important, but their impact varies depending on the stage of development.",7.5,6,7,7,9
"Some think that governments should tax unhealthy food to encourage people to eat healthier. To what extent do you agree or disagree?
","Many people argue that if governments introduce higher taxes on fast food, the number of consumers will decline. I completely agree with this view, as making junk food more expensive would reduce its popularity and lead to healthier lifestyles in society.

Firstly, fast food is one of the leading causes of obesity and other health issues. Preparing fresh and nutritious meals requires time and effort, whereas junk food is cheap, quick, and easily accessible. However, these products usually contain excessive amounts of fat, sugar, and artificial ingredients, offering little to no nutritional value and harming overall well-being. For instance, in the United States, obesity rates are highest in areas where fast food is widely consumed and affordable. By imposing higher taxes, governments can discourage frequent purchases and encourage people to cook at home or choose healthier alternatives.

Secondly, additional taxation can especially benefit younger generations, who are the main consumers of fast food. Teenagers often prefer pizza, fried chicken, or sugary drinks when meeting with friends, largely because such options are inexpensive. Unfortunately, regular consumption of these items increases the risk of diabetes and heart disease later in life. Evidence from the United Kingdom shows that after the introduction of the “sugar tax” in 2018, sales of high-sugar drinks dropped, and many companies reformulated their products with less sugar. This demonstrates that raising prices through taxation can effectively change eating habits and protect public health.

In conclusion, I strongly support the idea that governments should make junk food more expensive. By reducing its affordability, authorities can help people adopt healthier diets and improve overall quality of life in society.",7.5,7,7,7,8
"As well as making money, businesses also have social responsibilities. To what extent do you agree or disagree?
","t is generally accepted that the main reason many people decide to start a business is to generate massive income. However, some argue that businesses should regard social responsibilities as equally important as profit. I totally agree with this view, since businesses directly affect both people and the environment.

First and foremost, companies must consider consumers before distributing products. This is mostly because their goods affect people's lives by influencing their health, nutrition, and overall quality of life. For example, about 72% of people worldwide rely on company-produced food such as milk, rice, and bottled water to meet their daily needs. Therefore, firms should undergo rigorous processes before launching their products to ensure that the food is safe and suitable for consumption, particularly in terms of public well-being.

Furthermore, businesses also release pollution that impacts local communities. When companies ignore this issue and focus merely on profits, local communities inevitably suffer. For instance, PT. Tjiwi Kimia, a paper producer located near residential areas, has been criticised for contaminating local water supplies. Consequently, the company decided to provide free clean water for residents as a part of its corporate social responsibility. Such actions are a reasonable step to mitigate the harm they have caused.

In conclusion, social responsibilities are indeed a major concern for all business sectors, particularly in relation to consumer safety and environmental protection, which should be given the same priority as making money. I firmly believe that these duties are essential aspects of modern business practice, whether they are carried out by small or large companies.",7.5,6,6,8,9
"Some people think that modern technology is making people more sociable, while others think it is making them less sociable. Discuss both views and give your opinio
","Some people are of the view that modern technology is encouraging people to socialise. On the other hand, others suggest it is making them less sociable. I agree with the former view, as modes of communication are readily available, although it has its drawbacks, like a lack of willingness to connect.

The obvious benefit of technology advancements is the new social media apps. Apps like Instagram, Facebook, and Snapchat can be accessed anywhere and anytime, provided there is an internet connection. For instance, during the Coronavirus pandemic, social media enabled people to interact with each other no matter where they were. This encourages them to communicate with each other , no matter where they are located. This encourages people to socialise with one another. Furthermore, there are different methods of communication in these apps, varying from text to voice call to video call. Even games have a multiplayer feature, which indirectly forces you to communicate with your teammates to reach your goals.

However, with modern technology, there has been an increasing trend to stay at home during free time rather than go outside and socialise. This approach also makes it impossible for people to connect with each other. We can see globally that kids of this newer generation prefer to stay indoors and play games rather than go play outdoors.

In conclusion, although modern technology can reduce the willingness to communicate, I think that the abundant modes of communication that are readily available with technology make it easier to communicate.",7,5,5,8,9
"Nowadays, many people believe that technology has made working from home easier and more efficient, while others think it has caused more stress and less collaboration among colleagues. Discuss both these views and give your own opinion.","The advent of the internet and other technological advancements has led companies across the globe to adopt a remote working style for their employees. While some argue that it has made employees’ lives easier, others believe that it has increased stress and reduced collaboration among peers. This essay will further elaborate on both of these views and will provide my opinion in the conclusion.

The employees can benefit in several ways by working from home. The predominant gain is no daily commute to work. Since the employees will work from the comfort of their homes, they will not waste any time in traffic, transit, and pollution. This has a direct impact on their productivity, as it helps them to keep calm and relax. Additionally, it also enhances their mood.

However, the downside of this should not be overlooked, as it could cause some serious impacts on the company’s overall performance. The most significant drawback is the communication gap. Although the technology allows workers to collaborate with their colleagues online, it has its limitations. For example, the Mechanical Engineers often work on designing large assemblies with multiple sub-assemblies; they seldom feel that their message in an online meeting is not fully conveyed to others. Consequently, it led to endless revisions on every assembly, ultimately delaying the project and exceeding the budget. This can also cause high-level stress as they are always under pressure to work at a faster pace.

To conclude and provide my opinion, I think that the employees benefit from the technological advancements that allow them to work from home. However, the employees should only work from home once every few weeks for a change; otherwise, they should go to the office, as it will allow them to work seamlessly with their colleagues.

"In some countries, prisoners are allowed comfortable accommodation, good food, and healthcare. Do you think this is appropriate? To what extent do you agree or disagree? Give specific reasons and examples to support your position.","In numerous countries, the governing bodies are providing criminals with better food, suitable accommodation and great health benefits. While some contend that such a policy is necessary, others argue that there should be harsh conditions for the prisoners. Nevertheless ,this essay will discuss both perspectives and explain my viewpoint as well.

To begin, Illegal activities have become a pressing issue in many countries , and consequently, the number of individuals in jails is increasing daily. In some parts of the world, these humans are allowed comfortable beds, hygienic food and health , and this approach has a lot of benefits. First and foremost, it is a healthy life , as we all know, the ratio of deaths in jails is quite high . For instance, a recent survey in Pakistan showed that around 10k people died last year in prisons, due to the poor quality of life. Secondly, this approach helps reduce the number of crimes in prisons. If every individual is  provided with their own private, peaceful standard cell , then the ratio of illegal activities will decrease because most fights occur over better resources.

Apart from agreement, opponents argue that the government should provide minimal possible resources to prisoners as they will never then taste the actual penalty. As we know ,healthy cuisine and a medical system are necessities of life, so we shouldn’t compromise on that. However, the captives should feel the punishments by making them suffer in terms of accommodation.  Research conducted in the United Kingdom showed that approximately 50 per cent of people give up criminal habits when they feel punishment in terms of beds and sleeping schedule.

Few countries are providing criminals with comfortable accommodation, better food and a prime healthcare system. In light of the above facts , I admit that these are much-needed things , but I strongly agree with those advocating that prisoners should live in a harsh environment.",7,4,5,9,9
"Some people believe that children should learn science in school. Others think that it is not necessary to include science in general education. Do you agree or disagree with the statement? Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.
","The debate over learning science has persisted for decades in modern society. Some people argue that children should study science in school, whereas others believe that science is not a critical subject in general education. While public opinion is divided, I firmly believe that it is necessary to learn science in childhood. Science should be compulsory in general education because, without it, students lack basic scientific literacy for health, technology, and civic decisions.

Admittedly, some people claim that students have the freedom to choose their courses and subjects in modern society. Learning science may not be useful to students who major in business, history, or languages. Yet it is still necessary for primary students to learn science. The main reason is that learning science can boost children’s abilities. Science courses often include lab sessions where children conduct experiments. It is helpful to teach children hands-on skills. For instance, basic biology and numeracy help teenagers read a medicine label in mg per kg and avoid double-dosing. Energy literacy also allows families to compare an appliance’s kWh per year and choose an efficient model.

In addition, it is difficult to understand the theory of science. Thus, comprehending theory can stimulate children’s brains and develop their logical thinking. For example, a scientific theory often needs complex formulas to prove it. When students gather evidence, they might undergo a logical thinking process. Moreover, it is hard to find answers at first, and they might experience multiple failures. As a result, their problem-solving skills are boosted by overcoming difficulties.

To sum up, it is not easy to measure the level of influence on a personal career from learning science. From my perspective, Science is a core subject and should be compulsory in elementary school. Once students enter high school and take responsibility for their choices, they can choose any courses they want.",7,6,7,6,9
"In some countries, owning a home rather than renting one is very important for people.Why might this be the case?Do you think this is a positive or negative situation? Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.","In some societies , buying a house is a crucial priority instead of renting one , and by far the most effective factor is the unreliable economy of that country , and I assume it is an advantageous approach that supports dwellers to have a sustainable social and financial status.

People in a country with a turbulent economy are faced with countless financial problems , such as constantly rising costs for meeting their basic needs, importantly , their accommodation. Since buying a residence helps individuals to eradicate the unpredictable rising price of renting an accommodation, they tend to invest in owning a dwelling to achieve a more sustainable expenditure. To be clear, there is a report that states the rent payment in Tehran has increased by about 30% in  2025 , and only the renters group went under this financial trouble.

I assume buying a property instead of renting is an investment that is associated with two important advantages. Firstly, people save themselves from going through the upwarding trends of house-renting costs and expenditure problems , which gives them a sense of financial security and social sustainability. Furthermore, in  such an area holding a property whose cost upwards is an intelligent financial investment for the family and its next generation. For instance, statistics show the building outlay in Tehran has risen tenfold in the last decade.

In conclusion, a chaotic economy in some countries leads individuals to persist in owning a residence instead of renting it , and I believe it is a smart choice that not only saves families from financial troubles, but also helps them to have a brilliant investment for their own and their next generations.",7,5,4,9,9
The amount of time spent on sports and exercise should be increased in the schools in order to tackle the problem of overweight children. Do you think this is the best way to deal with the problem? What other solutions can you suggest?,"Nowadays, many children are becoming overweight, and this is a big problem for families and schools. Some people think that the best way to solve this issue is to give students more time for sports and exercise at school.  Others believe there are better options. This

essay will examine  the best way  to solve this problem and what other solutions I can suggest.

 In my opinion, extra activities at school will help , but it is not the best solution. First of all, doing exercise every day, away from school, is more effective. For example, when students play football, run, or swim, they burn calories and become more active. In addition, exercise makes them feel happier and less stressed, so they will not eat too much junk food. Therefore, I believe that increasing sports lessons in schools is a good idea. However, it is not enough on its own.

 I believe there are several solutions available to help the problem of child obesity. On the  other hand, healthy food is also very important. For instance, schools should serve more vegetables, fruits, and milk instead of fast food and sweet drinks. Moreover, parents should prepare balanced meals at home, because children eat most of their food there. In addition, the government can make campaigns on TV and social media to teach families about healthy habits. As a result, children will learn not only to exercise but also to eat   better .

In conclusion, sports and exercise are very useful, but they cannot solve the problem of overweight children alone. In my view, the best solution is a combination of more exercise, healthy food, and education. Only if schools, parents, and the government work together, will this issue be solved.",6.5,6,6,6,7
"Many people argue that in order to improve educational equality, high school students are encourage to make comments or even criticism on their teachers. Other think it will lead to loss of respect and discipline in the classroom. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.","In today’s world, education is one of the most important foundations of society. Some people believe that high school students should be encouraged to give comments or even criticism about their teachers, while others worry this could reduce respect and discipline in the classroom. This essay will discuss both sides and explain why I think student feedback can improve education if it is handled properly.

On the one hand, many people argue that student feedback may create problems. Teenagers are often young and emotional, and sometimes they do not give fair comments. For example, a student who dislikes mathematics may write negative feedback about the teacher, not because of the teacher’s style but simply because the subject feels boring or difficult. This type of criticism does not really help the teacher improve and can even lower motivation. For this reason, teachers need to know which comments are serious and which ones should be ignored.

On the other hand, student opinions can also be very useful. Feedback is not always negative; it can also include appreciation and suggestions. For instance, if students say that a science experiment helped them understand a difficult concept like rotation, this shows the teacher that the method is effective. Such comments encourage teachers to repeat successful techniques and make their lessons more engaging. In this way, students’ voices can motivate teachers and improve the overall quality of education.

In conclusion, student evaluations may sometimes be unfair, but they also have the power to support and guide teachers. In my view, most teachers are experienced enough to recognize constructive feedback and ignore unhelpful remarks. Therefore, student comments should be encouraged, as they can contribute to better teaching and more equal opportunities in education.",6.5,6,6,6,8
"Some conversations are eosier to have in person, while other conversations are easier on the phone or by text messaging. Do you find this to be true? Why or why not? In what situations do you prefer one mode of communication over another? Give reasons to support your opinion.","In recent years, the topic of face-to-face communication has emerged as a significant concern for the general public. While some individuals contend that face-to-face communication is easier for people, I maintain that making a phone call or sending text messages is also convenient and flexible.

On the one hand, it is essential to acknowledge the significance of face-to-face communication. A critical aspect to consider is that people can use body language, facial expressions, and tone, which help them convey emotions and meanings accurately. For instance, when someone furrows their brows and speaks in a low, tense voice, it usually indicates anger or frustration, even if their words are polite. What’s more, face-to-face conversations foster better mutual understanding, as these nonverbal cues reduce the chances of misinterpretation. For example, a friendly smile combined with a warm tone can make a simple greeting feel sincere, helping to build trust between speakers.

On the other hand, making a phone call or sending text messages plays an important role in modern life, as these methods allow people to communicate quickly and conveniently, regardless of distance. This type of communication is especially helpful when face-to-face interactions is not possible, such as when people live in different cities or have busy schedules. Moreover, text messages are often more time-efficient, enabling individuals to exchange essential informations without lengthy conversations. However, these methods may sometimes lack emotional depth, as they do not fully capture tone or body language, which can occasionally lead to misunderstandings.

Overall, both face-to-face communication and digital communication are essential in modern life. While nonverbal cues in direct conversations help express emotions and create stronger connections, phone calls and text messages provide convenience and speed, especially when distance is a barrier. Striking a balance between these two forms of communication is the key to maintaining healthy relationships.",6.5,6,6,6,7
"The practice of illegally hunting wild animals continues to cause concern in many countries ,particularly developing countries. What are the causes of such hunting? What are the effects on the animals and on the wider human society in these countries and beyond .","Illegal hunting of wildlife is a rising practice, especially in developing countries. The reason for this trend is mainly profits and to hunt for sport. This can cause extinction and endangerment of species.

The main cause of this practice is for profit. The hide and other parts of the animal are sold for a hefty price in the market. This forces one to hunt such sought-after animals as a source of profit. Elephant tusks and Rhino horns are examples of many desired merchandise. Another reason is to hunt for sport. A lot of hunters give large sums of money in order to poach the wildlife and take with them trophies to prove their worth. These trophies can be taxidermies or skins of the animals.

This practice is causing endangerment and the extinction of some species. The Dodo, a flightless, feathered bird that lived during the 17th century, was poached to extinction. The black horned rhino has almost been hunted to extinction, with only a few kept in captivity. This causes an ecosystem disruption, since the extinction of one species can cause the growth and reduction of another species. For instance, the elimination of apex predators causes the population of herbivores to peak; as a result, there will be overgrazing, leading to soil erosion. However, this can be tackled; the government can pass strict laws forbidding the poaching of wildlife, and strict actions are to be taken against anyone who does not abide by the law. In some parts of Africa, poaching is forbidden, and the outlaw is sent to prison or hanged based on the judge's decision.

 To conclude, this trend to hunt illegally is caused by the desperation of people to earn money or as a source of entertainment. This approach results in the diminishing of wildlife species populations and can cause ecological imbalance. Therefore, regulations should be passed by the government , and strict actions should be taken against the outlaws.",6.5,5,5,6,9
"Some people believe that children should learn science in school. Others think that it is not necessary to include science in general education. Do you agree or disagree with this statement ? Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.
","Recently, many people have been debating about whether we should include science in school education. I mainly agree that children need to learn this subject at school.

On the one hand, many consider that pupils need to study science in school because it is a better environment for them to learn it. Firstly, the professional teachers at school can help students correct their knowledge about science. Science is a specific field that requires high

proficiency, which means it is hard to learn without assistance. Therefore, school is a perfect place for students to acquire some basic science knowledge. Moreover, there are more resources in school than in a typical person’s home; thus, school is a more suitable environment.

On the other hand, there are a few who disagree with this idea, and here are the potential reasons. To begin with, science might not be as useful as some other subjects, like language and math. It is not a necessity for individuals because you can easily live without understanding any deep science knowledge. On the contrary, parents argue that they can teach their children about this subject at home, so there is no need to waste time at school on this. However, I regard science as a necessary lesson for students in school, because it is a subject that enables students to have a diverse view, and there are many useful resources that can be taken at school.

In conclusion, despite the fact that there are some arguments about including science in basic education, I believe that the overall benefits outweigh the disadvantages.",6.5,4,6,6,9
"Some museums charge for admission while others are free. Do you think that the advantages of charging outweigh the disadvantages?
","In today’s contemporary world, museums play a significant role in preserving cultural heritage and educating the public. While some museums offer free admission, others charge an entrance fee. Both approaches involve certain benefits and drawbacks.Hence, a balanced evaluation is necessary.

 On the one hand, museums play a vital role in education, particularly for children. By visiting museums, they can learn about their national history, traditions, and culture in a more engaging way than in school textbooks. For example, children who have the chance to visit museums can learn more effectively, as such experiences make education entertaining and easier to understand. This not only improves their knowledge but also increases their motivation to learn. Moreover, when museums are free, more people can benefit from these opportunities regardless of their financial situation, whereas if they are paid, the number of visitors may decrease significantly.

 On the other hand, charging an entrance fee is necessary for the sustainability of museums. Museums need a lot of money for building maintenance, electricity, security, staff salaries, and new exhibitions. Furthermore, when visitors pay, they often value the experience more and spend more time exploring the exhibits. However, these fees should remain reasonable, because extremely high prices may discourage people from visiting. A balanced approach, such as offering discounts for students or free entry on certain days, can make museums both financially stable and accessible to the wider public.

 To sum up, museums are very meaningful for both our past and our future, as they preserve history while also reflecting modern development. In order to encourage both adults and children to visit museums, the price should be affordable for all budgets, but at the same time it should help cover the costs of running the museum.",6,5,5,6	,8
"Some conversations are eosier to have in person, while other conversations are easier on the phone or by text messaging. Do you find this to be true? Why or why not? In what situations do you prefer one mode of communication over another? Give reasons to support your opinion
","In recent years, it is argued that face-to-face communication is more effective than making phone calls or sending text messages. However, I believe that both methods have their own merits and should be used depending on context. This essay aims to provide a comprehensive analysis of these differing viewpoints.

    On the one hand, it is essential to acknowledge the significant advantages of in-person discussions. A crucial consideration is that people can use body language, facial expressions, and tone of voice, which help them convey emotions and meanings more accurately. For example, when friends meet directly to solve a misunderstanding, their gestures and tone often make it easier to rebuild trust compared to just exchanging texts. Moreover, face-to-face interaction usually strengthens emotional bonds, which is particularly valuable in maintaining close friendships and family relationships.

     On the other hand, making phone calls or sending text messages play an integral role in modern life. They are convenient for people who live far away or cannot meet directly. For example, students studying abroad can call their parents every day, which helps them feel less lonely and more connected to their family. In addition, sending a short message is often faster and easier when people only need to share simple information, such as confirming a time or place. From my perspective, I lean towards making a phone call or sending text messages, this is due to the fact that I find it very convenient. Therefore, this form of communication is flexible and save time in daily life.

     In conclusion, while face-to-face conversations enable people to express emotions and ideas more effectively, digital communication offers greater convenience. A combination of both approaches not only ensures effective interaction but also helps people stay connected, maintain stronger relationships, and adapt to the fast pace of modern society.",6,5,6,6,6
"In many countries today, crime novels and TV crime dramas are becoming more and more popular. Why do you think these books and TV shows are popular? What is your opinion of crime fiction and TV crime dramas?
","In today's modern era, a growing trend leads to crime novels and TV crime dramas becoming increasingly popular. I believe that this phenomenon stems from people's tendency to enjoy books and dramas with thrilling and adventurous storylines, which provide them an enjoyable experience.

To begin with, people inherently desire to seek everything that sharpens their minds. These programs not only make them more curious but also inform them of diverse crimes. In addition, some books present stories based on real facts, adding emotional value to them. For instance, books that contain narratives about war allow individuals to understand the harsh conditions of war and become more aware of the facts of war, which is both engaging and informative. Hence, people like to read books and watch movies that raise awareness while keeping them engaged.

In my opinion, these books and TV shows can help people to respond efficiently in similar situations, give individuals valuable insights concerning crimes, and allow them to experience suspenseful and engaging moments, helping people to develop in their personal and professional lives. A pertinent example is Mr. Judge, a TV show in Iran that showcases real stories about diverse crimes. It allows viewers to improve their understanding of law, current crimes, and fines. Thus, these programs can act as informal mentors, teaching viewers valuable lessons about society.

To sum up, these showcases and books have focused on sparking people's curiosity, which enables them to convey important ideas to their audiences in a thoughtful way. Consequently, people experience more delightful moments while gaining essential information.",6,5,6,7,6
An increasing number of children are overweight which could result many problems when they grow older both in terms of their health and health care costs. Why do you think so many children are overweight? What could be done to solve this problem,"The  world is very different today , and that includes how children live. Many children nowadays are overweight, and this is a serious problem.   This also means that when they are older, they will have terrible health issues and high health costs.  This essay will examine why  I think so many children are overweight and what could be done to solve this problem.



I believe  that  children today are overweight for many reasons. First, many children eat junk food. Also , they drink sugary drinks instead of water. Second, one of the biggest things leads a person to be overweight  is being lazy. Children spend too much time on the phone or computer . Moreover ,they don’t play outdoors or do sports because they are in their room with their technology. Finally, some parents do not  set a good example.  For instance, they do not encourage healthy food or playing sports.



On the other hand , there are several solutions to help these children. First, eat healthy food. It is very good for the body. For example, children should eat more fruits and vegetables. They should eat less junk food and sugar. Second, one of the most important things to lose weight and be healthy is to do exercise. For example, children should play outdoors every day. Also, do sports every day. It will help children to stay healthy and fit. Finally, parents should teach their children about good habits,  thus making  their lives healthy. Also, schools should teach them about a healthy lifestyle. Moreover, this will help them to be healthier in the future.",6,5,4,6,8
"Many people believe that it is better for children to grow up in the countryside rather than in a big city. What are the advantages and disadvantages of each place?
","Many people contend that it is better for children to grow up in the countryside, while others maintain that big cities have more advantages. This essay will discuss both environments before presenting a reasoned conclusion.

The countryside is typically characterized by a community of small villages with natural surroundings. This provides children with ample opportunity to play outside, which not only promotes physical activity and a connection with the natural world but also leads to better physical and mental health. Studies from the University of Freiburg show that going for a walk in the forest for only half an hour a day can boost dopamine and increase happiness. With nature always near, this can contribute to a happy and healthy life.

On the other hand, living in the countryside limits children's access to educational, cultural, and social opportunities. Due to long travel times, they might find it difficult to participate in extracurricular activities, attend specialized schools, or visit museums and theaters, which are more common in cities. Furthermore, this leads to less diversity, which can limit a child's exposure to different cultures and ways of thinking. This can sometimes result in feelings of social isolation, as they may have a smaller peer group to interact with outside of school. In summary, children have restricted access to a wide range of activities and less choice of people to interact with.

In conclusion, while the countryside provides children with access to nature and a healthier lifestyle, it also limits their access to a wide range of activities and a smaller pool of people to connect with. Ultimately, both environments have distinct advantages and disadvantages, and the choice of where to raise a family is a personal one.",6,6,6,6,6
"Some people think that outdoor activities are more beneficial for children's development than playing computer games. What extent do you agree or disagree.
","In the contemporary era, there is a heated debate regarding whether outdoor activities are more beneficial for children than indoor computer-based games. Some individuals strongly believe that outdoor activities play a vital role in children’s development, while others argue in favor of indoor activities. I firmly agree with the former view, and the following paragraphs will highlight my perspective, leading to a logical conclusion.

To begin with, outdoor games greatly contribute to children’s physical and mental well-being. When kids engage in outdoor play, they stay healthy, active, and energetic throughout the day. Moreover, outdoor activities provide opportunities for children to make new friends, socialize, and learn valuable life skills such as teamwork, cooperation, and discipline. For instance, many schools encourage students to participate in outdoor sports by including dedicated periods for games. Through such activities, children not only build friendships but also develop essential social and ethical values.

On the other hand, spending excessive time on indoor computer or mobile games can be harmful to children. Online platforms often expose them to addictive habits, reduced physical activity, and limited social interaction. As a result, children who prioritize indoor games may struggle with creativity and cognitive development compared to those who engage in outdoor play. In contrast, outdoor games enhance critical thinking, strengthen the brain, and nurture a more powerful and active mind.

In a nutshell, while both types of activities have their place, outdoor games are significantly more beneficial for children’s overall growth. They not only promote good health but also foster social and intellectual development—factors that indoor computer games cannot provide. Therefore, outdoor activities should be encouraged for the holistic development of today’s youth.",5.5,6,4,6,6
"The tendency of human beings to copy one another is shown in the popularity of fashion in clothes and consumer goods. To what extent do you agree and disagree?
","In contemporary consumer society, the rise of fashion trends and the popularity of certain consumer goods are significant cultural phenomena. Many argue that these trends serve as clear evidence of the innate human tendency to imitate one another. While I concur that the desire for imitation is a key driver behind these patterns, I contend that attributing this phenomenon solely to a herd mentality is an oversimplification, as it overlooks other crucial forces such as the need for individual expression and the pursuit of quality.

Undeniably, the inclination to copy plays a pivotal role in the proliferation of trends in fashion and consumer goods. A primary motivator for this is the deep-seated human need for social belonging. Individuals, particularly young people, often adopt popular styles or purchase sought-after products to integrate into a peer group and avoid feelings of exclusion. For instance, when a specific model of athletic footwear becomes a craze in a school, owning a pair acts as a social ""entry ticket,"" a choice driven less by an appreciation for the shoe's design and more by peer pressure and the desire for group identity. Furthermore, the emulation of celebrities and social media influencers significantly fuels consumer demand. When a respected public figure endorses a luxury item or promotes a particular brand, their followers are often compelled to make similar purchases, viewing it as a way to connect with their idols or elevate their own social standing.

However, to reduce complex consumer behaviour to mere imitation would be to ignore other fundamental motivations. Firstly, fashion and consumer goods are frequently used as powerful tools for self-expression and identity formation. A consumer might select a niche designer's clothing to project an image of uniqueness, or purchase products made from sustainable materials to reflect their environmental values. In these instances, the purchasing decision is a deliberate act of differentiation, not conformity. Secondly, the intrinsic quality and functionality of a product are often the true catalysts for its popularity. A product gains widespread acclaim not just because it is trendy, but because it genuinely satisfies a consumer need through superior design, durability, or performance. The enduring global success of Apple's iPhone, for example, is not solely attributable to its status symbol; it is deeply rooted in its intuitive user interface, robust ecosystem, and reputation for reliability—a choice often based on rational assessment rather than simply following the crowd.

In conclusion, while the human tendency to imitate is undoubtedly a powerful force in shaping trends in clothing and consumer goods, it is by no means the sole determinant. A more comprehensive understanding must acknowledge that consumer choices are a complex interplay of social pressures, the quest for personal identity, and a rational evaluation of a product's inherent worth. Therefore, viewing popular trends as merely a product of our copycat nature is to underestimate the multifaceted motivations that drive human behaviour.",5.5,7,4,5,6
"Some scientist think that there are intelligent life forms on other planets and message should be sent to contact them other scientist think that it is a bad idea and would be dangerous. Discuss both the view and give your opinion
","Some scientists suggest that we should send messages into space to try to contact intelligent life forms on other planets. However, others believe that this would be dangerous for humanity. This essay will discuss both views before giving my own opinion.

On the one hand, sending messages to other civilizations could bring many benefits. Firstly, it might allow us to gain valuable scientific knowledge. For example, if another civilization is more advanced than us, they could share technology that helps us solve problems on Earth, such as disease or climate change. Secondly, humans have always been curious and eager to explore the unknown. Reaching out to other planets is simply a continuation of this natural desire for exploration. Finally, some argue that Earth already releases radio and television signals into space, so sending deliberate messages would not increase the risks significantly.

On the other hand, many scientists argue that this idea is risky. One reason is that we do not know the intentions of other life forms. If they are hostile, revealing our location could put humanity in danger. Another reason is that history shows what can happen when stronger civilizations meet weaker ones; the weaker side often suffers. Therefore, it is possible that contacting aliens would lead to negative consequences. In addition, this decision should not be made by a small group of researchers because the risks affect the entire world.

In my opinion, the dangers are more serious than the possible advantages. Instead of actively sending messages, we should focus on listening for signals and improving our technology to study space. If one day we decide to send messages, it should only happen with international agreement and careful planning.

In conclusion, while contacting other life forms could give us new knowledge and opportunities, it also carries serious risks. For now, a cautious approach is the most reasonable choic",5.5,5,4,6,6
"nowadays many cities face traffic jam what causes this what are solutions
","In recent years, there has been a rising problem of traffic congestion in many large cities. However, despite  the number of causes, I strongly believe that the issue can be partially solved with infrastructure development and management of traffic incidents. In this essay, I will analyse the causes of traffic jams and propose some potential solutions.

The main cause of traffic jams in big cities is a bad infrastructure. Developed cities have a big level of immigration. People sick improvement in their lives improve in bigger cities , which leads to an overflow of population and subsequently to traffic congestion. The hour-long traffic jam can be created by an accident that happened in the middle of the road. Accidents can significantly slow down traffic on the roads. There is also an act of rubbernecking, which also aggravates the situation.

One possible solution would be the development of road infrastructure. Narrow roads can't cope with the rising number of vehicles. Accordingly, road expansion, additional lines for bicycles and buses can greatly improve road traffic. Additionally, we can encourage citizens to use bicycles and scooters in warm seasons to reduce the number of vehicles on the roads. In addition to infrastructure development, to tackle the problem of accidents on the roads, police officers should regulate the management of traffic incidents. Some accidents surely can take up the whole road , which substantially slows the traffic down or fully stops it. Good management is definitely able to decrease this challenge.

In conclusion, while the problem of traffic jams in large cities is serious, it can be solved by the development of road infrastructure and the coordination of traffic accidents.

Overall,  hard work on improving the lives of people can fix  most  of the issues in the cities for sure.",5.5,4,5,4,8
"Nowadays, there are many students who choose to study abroad to improve their skills and education. While others prefer to study in their home country. This essay will examine the advantages and disadvantages of studying abroad.
","Society  is very different today , and that includes education. Nowadays, there are many students who choose to study abroad to improve their skills and education. While others prefer to study in their home country. This essay will examine the advantages and disadvantages of studying abroad.

On the one hand, studying abroad has multiple benefits for students.  First,  students can learn a new language. For example, they can speak English every single day in class and in their private life. This helps them to communicate better and understand more clearly. Second, students can learn about a different  culture. For instance, they can meet new people, and make lasting  friendships.  They can learn and experience  different activities. Moreover, this helps them to become more open and friendly. In addition, studying abroad  can also help students become independent. As a result, they can solve problems and make decisions by themselves.

On the other hand, studying abroad can also have some difficulties. First, studying in another country can be expensive. For example, students must pay for school, food, and housing. In addition, some students may face money problems. Second, students can suffer from homesickness. For instance, they are away from their family  and friends. As a result, they may feel sad and  miss home a great deal. Moreover, it can be hard to adjust to a new culture. This means students need time to learn new habits and ways of life.

In conclusion, it is clear to see that studying abroad has several useful advantages. However, it can also present some serious disadvantages.",5.5,6,4,6,6
"Many aspects of the way people dress today are influenced by global fashion trends. How has global fashion become such a strong influence on people’s lives? Do you think this is a positive or negative development? Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.
","Many people have changed in recent years due to the influence of fashion. There are reasons for this change, and we will discuss these reasons in our essay.

Well, the public always likes changes in fashion, such as new designs of dresses or suits. On the other hand, there are some people who do not like this development in their countries, because it will open some areas that are not allowed to be opened, such as the sensitive areas of the body. We have to look at our society before changing anything. If they think it will be great for their community and their life, then it will be good, because the opinions are the most important things.

From my perspective, there are a lot of positives and some negatives, but in my opinion, I think sometimes we have to change our designs, but in a stable way, without forgetting our heritage, like new colors of clothes. For instance, when we decide to wear new clothes, we must make our appearance respectable. For example, some people do not care how people look at them; they wear ripped pants without a shirt, and they think they are awesome and cool, but the truth is they are disrespectful.

In conclusion, I believe that fashion trends are important to our lifestyle. If we do not make any changes, we will feel bored and uncomfortable. Fashion affects the lives of some people who do not see fashion correctly. For example, someone who believes that if they do not wear a new style, or this type of fashion, they will be unpopular in society.",5,4,4,6,6
"These days it is much easier for many people to travel to different countries for tourism than in the past. Do the advantages of this development outweigh the disadvantages?
","There is a general consensus that society these days has it much easier commuting to different nations for tourism than in the past. Personally, i'd say the positive aspects of this development could overshadow its negative sides.

There are a range of benefits to effortless travelling. One of the main advantages is that emergency needs of travelling can certainly be met quickly. It is because the number of ways to commute around has increased more than before. For instance like meeting with someone on their deathbed absolutely cannot be delayed, and nowadays, means of transportation have made it way smoother. Another huge advantage is that it is now much more cost-effective when go to another country these days cause of the normalcy of far-distance means of transportation. Back then, far travelling was exclusively available to long voyages or car trips. But the options are much more flexible now with airplanes and faster cars.

However, in spite of these  advantages, there are several drawbacks to the convenience of travelling. Firstly, it is harder to control and preserve the privacy of countries' borders. Since everyone has easy access to other countries, ill-intended individuals or groups have found  loopholes to illegally cross borders. For example, Mexicans are famous for border invasion cause of how easy it was to travel to the USA. Secondly, uncontrolled tourism may cause pollution in nations with less strict policies.

In conclusion, travelling from one country to another for tourism purposes seems more uncomplicated than it was before. Although the possible harms are still lurking, i suppose its potential merits are worthwhile.",5,4,5,5,5
"Some people believe that younger family members should be legally responsible for supporting older family members when they become physically, mentally and financially unable to take care of themselves. To what extent do you agree or disagree?
","It is argued that younger family members are responsible lawfully for supporting elder family members who are incapable physically, mentally and financially to look after themselves. I completely disagree with this idea due to some compelling reasons.

To begin with, most young people struggle to find a job and to be financially independent. Moreover, youngers who have partner and children have difficulty finding a job and supporting themselves. Hence, imposing a compulsory obligation on young people to take care of their parents not only restricts their freedom but also creates extra stress and pressure on them. As a result, both young people feel emotionally insufficient in their life and parents may feel upset about they are a burden to their children.

Furthermore, elderly people sometimes need professional medical and psychological care, and family members may not be qualified to provide this to them. Therefore, well-being of older family members should be responsibility of governments within the scope of a social state. Consequently, instead of enforcing for young people to support their old relatives, the government should provide professional help to elderly citizens in terms of free or affordable fees. For instance, in many countries, states fund healthcare services including nursing or community health programs to take the burden off young family member’s shoulders.

In conclusion, elderly individuals often require specialized medical and psychological care, therefore, ensuring their well-being should remain the responsibility of the government. Considering these compelling reasons I strongly disagree that young family members ought to be legally obliged to care for older relatives who are unable to look after themselves physically, mentally, or financially.",5,5,6,4,4
"Some people say that professional workers such as doctors, nurses and teachers, who make greater contribution to society, should be paid more than those people in the field of sports and entertainment. To what extent do you agree or disagree?
","Every profession is contributing equally to the growth of the economy. Few masses say that there are certain job positions like doctors, nurses and teachers, which are investing a lot in society's development, deserve's great amount of salary package ,however, the entertainment and sports areas should receive less. I am in accord with this statement to an extent and will shed light on my viewpoints in the upcoming paragraphs.

To commence with,professions related to sports and entertainment play a crucial role in the well-being of society. In this day and age, due to high living expenses, people are becoming workaholics , which can predispose to many issues like stress.To tackle that stress level, the entertainment industry helps to eliminate such problems .For instance, watching comedy movies is quite popular and a stress-buster activity for individuals.Moreover, people who choose to be athletes,can serve their nation globally. Sports events like the Olympics are recognised internationally and give equal recognition to the players from distinct countries.Therefore,  both industries should deserve good remuneration.

On the flip side of the coin,the healthcare and teaching sectors are very demanding for the growing population.Every individual can dream of anything big only after getting appropriate education from the teacher. Moreover, teachers deal with a number of questions from students of all abilities, which is quite challenging. To cite an epitome, one survey revealed that teaching is the only field which demands more involvement.In addition to this, people spend ample hours before acquiring degrees in healthcare.For example, Degrees like MBBS require constant study of 21 hours  a day .Hence, it deserves a good pay rate as it involves lots of theoretical and practical knowledge .

To conclude, all job sectors are contributing in their own respective ways to the economy .With the aim ,they should get the same level of recognition in terms of pay,benefits and security.",5,5,5,5,5
"Some conversations are easier to have in person, while other conversations are easier on phone or by text messaging. Do you find this to be true? why or why not? In what situations do you prefer one mode of communication over another? Give reasons to support your opinion?
","In recent times, the issues of communication have emerged as a matter of significant concern to the general public. While some individuals maintain that using face-to-face communication. However, I contended that the phone call or text messaging. This essay aims to provide or comprehensive analysis of these differing viewpoints .

On the one hand, it is essential to acknowledge the significant advantages associated with face-to-face communication. A critical consideration is that individuals using body language and facial expression, which  that helps listeners understand the story better and avoid misunderstandings. In addition, another important point to emphasise is that person discussion is more focused, avoids misunderstandings. This is due to the fact that helps solve problems more easily, connect more deeply.

On the other hand, it is crucial to examine the opposing viewpoint that in phone or text messaging. A key factor to explore is that useful for remembering details, which underscores that when we see it, it will be easy to remember and save on the computer.Furthermore, it is essential to highlight that make bridge the gap, when people are far apart or meeting in person is not feasible, they may not need to meet but still talk and connect with each other.

In conclusion, despite the clear benefits of face-to-face communication in fostering understanding, empathy, and deeper connections, I'm of the opinion that phone calls and text messaging also play an important role. They allow people to maintain relationships across distances, save time, and bring us closer together in a fast-paced world.",5,4,4,6,6
"Access to clean water is a basic human right. Therefore every home should have a water supply that is provided free of charge.
","There have been some discussions over whether the human right to have access to clean water creats an obligation that any homes ought to receive it for free or not. I personally think that human rights does not mean free accessibility.

On the one hand, it is argued that governments are responsible for providing clean water for people's homes based on human rights for two reasons. First, people pay taxes, and governments and other organizations are held responsible for catering some basic people's needs, including clean water. In fact, people have already paid the cost of water they are consuming when paying a part of their income to governments. Moreover, the rate of public health can increase. It is evident that most water resources are not appropriate for drinking, and they may lead to some serious diseases which are detrimental to human societies when consumed by people.

Having said that, I personally concede that having access to clean water is a human right, but it should not be completely free for several reasons. Firstly, the amount of available clean water is not enough to be provided for each person. In other words, a huge amount of groundwater initially has to be refined to be suitable for consumption. The governments cannot afford to do it alone. Secondly, no one can deny when people have access to something for free, they do not pay necessary attention to optimal consumption. It can result in an increase in wastewater amount. With regard to the water crisis, it may bring about some irreparable damage. Finally, that how much water is used in any house or apartment is different based on the surface area those homes have. It is fair that people who consume a much larger amount of clean water pay more.

To sum up, having access to free clean water as a basic human right for each home would result in high level of hygiene and also people have already paid its cost by paying taxes, but I completely disagree because of the water crisis and its repercussions. Regarding to the water crisi and people's behavior when they face with free services or products they receive, clean water should not be free at all.",4.5,4,5,4,4
"Some people say that the only reason for learning a foreign language is in order to travel to or work in a foreign country. Others say that these are not the only reasons why someone should learn a foreign language. Discuss both these views and give your own opinion. Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.
","In this contemporary epoch, there is an ongoing debate overwhether the main reason for learning a foreign language is to apply job in a foreign business and to visit abroad or other reasons can contributed to purpose for learning a new language. In this essay, both view will be objectively deliberated prior to a logical conclusion.

On the one hand, there are some purposes some individuals think learning a language to travel or to work in abroad is the main reason. Firstly, it can help you some positive aspects when you go abroad. For example, there are a number of countries choosing English as a second language for citizens and people who visit to their nations can basily to communication. Therefore, visitors can have a chance to know more about their cultural and historic not just through the translater but by themselves, this trend has become more and more popular as some nation are going to plan that should add a third language like VietNam, China or Thailand. Furthermore, it can also give people more opportunities to work abroad. By this I mean, when you learning English or other language and become a professional in that language, you will have more chance that business will send you to companies that in other nations. At there, you can meet new employees who come all over the world, learn new or invole to more deep knowledge which will help you gain more to develop yourself. Thus, you might have opportunities to work with some projects that there have ever been before, this will give you a good eye in employers to give you to a higher position.

On the other hand, I hold a firm belief that there are many reasons for individuals to learn a new language. The first and the most persuasive reason is that it will help you a lot in daily life. A vivid illustration is that in VietNam where English is a second language and people learn it everday since VietNam is one of the most nations that attracted travelers from all over the world come to visit. Therefore, learning a second language can help citizens communicate to foreign visitors when they have some issues or in trouble. As a result, many travelerss have rated VietNam people as a kind and friendly and help VietNam becomes more reliabe in other nation friends. In addition, learning a new language especially English can give you more opportunities to get into a better univesities or companies. Specifically, having a qualification like IELTS can help you several benefit as it is a nation qualificate showing how good you are. Therefore, you can apply to universities or companies that offer a language qualification more easily.

"In many countries, people are now living longer than ever before. Some people say an ageing population creates problems for governments. Other people think there are benifits if society has more eldery people .To what extent do the advantages of having an ageing population outweigh the disadvantages.
","The phenomenon of people living longer than ever in many countries. Some argue that an aging population creates challenges for the government while others believe that elderly people can benefit to the society. Although there are advantages of aging population to the society, I strongly believe that there are outweighed by the disadvantages because of the burden on the healthcare system and the unfair distribution of resources.

Regarding the positive side of aging society to the society, properly the most significant benefit is that their knowledge and knowledge can contribute to the society. Elderly individuals have spent long time in their workforce. They often possess valuable experience and expertise for the problem-solving skills. For example, many senior people hold the top positions in companies and government for the management decisions. However, although their experience is valuable in the leadership role, the younger people is more innovative and adaptable in their work for improvement and implementation in the progress. For this reason, the companies and government are more likely to recruit the younger people for the lower and mid-level roles.

Despite the benefits of the aging population to the society, we should not overlook is that the older people increase the burden of the healthcare service. They are generally more prone to illnesses and chronic health issues, requiring more medical attention and treatments. A striking illustration is that a studied research by AIG, one of biggest worldwide insurance companies has showed that the portion of annual budget spent on the olderly people is larger than other age group over 30%. This could lead to the situation that the government struggles to provide adequate care for everyone, creating the unfair distribution of the resources.

In conclusion, the elderly people is greatly beneficial to the society. However, the financial strain they place on the healthcare system poses a significant challenge. Therefore, I firmly believe that the disadvantages of an aging population outweigh the advantages.",4.5,5,5,4,4
"new research has shown that overeating has a bigger problem than hunger, what are the reasons for this problem? how can it be solved?
","In recent times, a novel publication from researcher illustrated people has issue in over consumptions larger than appetites. For this case, we need to brainstorm to isolate what is the cause of problem and demonstrate the solutions for solving it. In this essay. I will shows the point, giving examples, and providing the solutions.

A key reason for this issue lies in the effect from overeat in humans with long-term effects on health and life quality. From my opinion, the biggest consequence of overeating increases the likelihood of developing both diabetes and high blood pressure. For some reasons that make people eat too much, for example, firstly, feelings such as stress, sadness, or boredom can lead to eating more, even when not hungry. Secondly, while people are easily access to unhealthy food products, people do less activities by order food to their places. In addition, societies can push people to eat too much at times family meals, friends, work culture.

To address this issue, I would provide considerable solutions such as people should have individual personal knowledge about healthy routine, nutrition, and portion of food combining with personal plan meals, eat slowly, use smaller portions, drink water, get enough sleep and do exercise properly at least 3 times per week. Moreover, should read food labels to consider the ingredients before purchase, and limit consumption for junk food, sugary drinks.

In conclusion, even though overeating has a bigger problem than hunger, real changes by many people can lower overeating and improve health over time.",4.5,4,5,4,4
"“Many people think that museums and galleries should only show work from local artists rather than work from other countries. Do you agree?”
","Some people believe that museums and galleries should display art created by local artists, while others think international works are also important. I agree with this point because local arts help people to show their creativity, gain knowledge about their own culture and less expensive than international arts.

Firstly, arts is a creative subject which make people more genius. If the government value the traditional art in the museums, the local artists will be more inspire on their work. Consequently, they could be made more valuable arts which represent the national culture and tradition. For example: Italy and France have numerous gallery which gives them back enormous tourists and profit, because they value their own traditional art. So, focus on own culture makes people extraordinary on their work.

Secondly, storing the internation arts in the gallery are much expensive than local arts. First of all, bringing one art from another countries need license which make extra cost. Furthermore, transportation cost is also expensive. Above all, getting license and transportation cost is too remarkable to local art. On the contrary, majority of the local people will ben not also interest about the international work if the arts do not keep play place on people mind, so how it can take place on museum. So, paying extra cost in on museum.

In conclusion, local art should be placed on museum which give bring peoples creativity on the arts and less expensive than international arts.So,government should be encouraged people about local exhibition than international arts.",4.5,5,5,4,4
"The migration of people to cities is one of the biggest problems facing the world's cities today. Disccus the main causes.What solutions could be used to tackle this situation.
","There is a general consensus that one of the most concerning issues of cities around the world today is the people migrating from one city to another. This essay will explores the crucial reasons and what solutions could be used to handle this phenomenon.

There are a variety of causes for the increasing number of migrations to other cities.

One of the main reasons is that the unbalance within cities' developments has cause more and more people to move to more advanced cities. For instance, Ben Tre's advancement obvious couldn't stand a chance against Ha Noi. Another huge point is the lack of appreciation for local culture. Some communities obliviously reject local customs and replace it with the trending activities. For example, in Vietnamese Mid Autumn Festival, instead of eating the traditional moon cake, some choose to eat a national Jakarta dish called Tekukka. This is such a major disrespect to their ancestors and should be banned.

Though the situation is complicating and arduous, different effective measures could be taken by governments to resolve such phenomenon. Firstly, authorities can make their cities better by applying more potent policies. Simple things that could be improved such as better sanitation, faster and more stable internet and electric speed, pension policies. Secondly, educators should teach kids to embrace and modernize their cultural traditions rather than abandoning it.

In conclusion, there are quite a few reasons for the rising number of migrations to other cities, such as the distinct differents between developed cites and underdeveloped ones. Even though the challenge stood as demanding and strenous, local governments can embrace their culture and register stern policies in improving their environment to mitigate the situation.",4,4,4,4,4
"Some people believe that it is better language students in small classes. Others think the number of people in the classes doesn't matter. Discuss both these views and give your own opinion.
","There is a debate how many students should be in language lessons, with some saying small classes are better, others arguing the quantity of learners is not important. In my opinion, while the number of student is not crucial in learning language, the lessons in small classes are more efficient.

The lessons which conducted in mini groups are more effective. As in small classes will have opportunities to work individually with students, especially with those who have difficulty to learn language. In order to achieve good results of all students, teachers should make interactive lessons and give extra tasks to learners who do not have  enough knowledge comparing to their group mates to reach the same level. Thus, all students in small groups can participate actively during the lesson because of teachers opportunity to work individually with all learners.

On the other hand, some people say that the number of students do not affect on students learning process. As in small groups and big groups will have lessons based on the program. The results of students depend on themselves. Because the role of teachers is on 10% and 90% of efficiency of learning new language depending on how student gain this knowledge. Therefore, even if the lessons will have on big groups , students can participate actively and achieve good results.

All things considered, the role of knowing of foreign language is crucial in today’s world. So, by learning it in small classes or big classes , students can achieve good results. However, in my opinion, mini groups are more efficient in order to achieve good results. As many youths becoming introvert ,they can not participate actively in big classes.",4,4,4,4,4

While it is a commonly held belief that some people like to runing the place where they live, there is also an argument other people like to walk where they live.

On one hand , no need any public transportation and keep your money from car fuel also remember the benefits exercising it improves heart and lung health also Sports help control weight. In addition, the runing with neighbours, friends or children increases the enjoyment of time. For example, some people they themselves to walk from their house to enter long walking competitions and win a lot of money. On the one other hand, some men and women like it change places in sports.

Moreover, some residential neighbourhoods are small and narrow and you cannot walking in them. For instance , become now has a lot of special places in Saudi Arabia it very big earth and more families from all over the world. In conclusion , there are no easy answers to this question. On balance, however, l tend to believe that the change place is essential for keeping on runing always so suggest create walking paths near parks and walking trails near parks, marking locations, and posting them on social media.",4,4,4,4,4
"The qualities and skills that people require to be successful in today’s world cannot be learned at university or at other academic institutions. To what extent do you agree or disagree?
","It has been said that in this contemporary scenario, students in schools are not being taught certain life changing skills those are essential to be successed in life. Therefore, i strongly disagree with the given statement which would be discussed in the upcoming parahraphs.

To begin with, academic institutes are more aware about the future and required proficiencies of students nowadays. That is why, along with theorical, schools also teach practical knowledge, which has far more immediate and meaningful impact on the well being of learners. In other words, in spite of teaching in classroom, students are being taken to their study of field for live session either it is medical, IT or mechanical sector. For example, after completing course in universities or colleges, medical students are sent for apprenticeships in clinics and hospitals to practice patient care, how to use equipments, and understand real hospoital work.

Moreover, since the popularity of games is escalating, institues are probably more intented to organising sports programes or events in schools which directly promotes the games and beget the interest about the importance of games among the pupils. Hence, sports are more superior field to be succeed thesedays, learners start playing for school then state, and national, which later progress to international level, develop significant skills and achieve considerable goal in life. For instance, Virat Kholi a renowned Indian cricketer played in Vishal Bharti Public school in Delhi then State under 15,17 category, later joined india in 2008 and won world cup under 19. Finally became the caption of India Cricket team in 2013.

In conclusion, I personally discord with the given statement because educational institutes not only teaching academic but also practical abilities to the students to get sucess in life.",4,4,4,4,4
"many University students live with their families, while others live away from home because the universities are in different place what are the advantages and disadvantages of both situation ?
","Some of the pupils who study high-level education live with their parents, while others may live far from their families depending on the place of  study. This essay will first suggest that living far from home can improve life skills, while living with your parents may lead to be more indulgence.

The main benefit that you might have by living away from your hometown, is self-reliance. Now you can do everything by yourself, and learn how to survive in this world; in addition, you will gain experience about how to treat people. For example, the UK statistics show that 37% of people who study abroad, became more successful in their lives, and most of them declared that they wouldn't have succeeded without living alone.

Despite this successful benefit, there are some consequences of living away , such as  you will find it hard to adapt to the new environment. We as human beings, we want someone around us when sadness or happy, so we won't have anyone to express our feelings, it's abit difficult to travel abroad. Take me for example, I used to have my brother beside me when I got sick or even when I wanted to talk with him, but when I travelled to study, I felt emptiness, especially when I was diagnosed with bone softness, and I really wanted someone next to me.

In conclusion, living away from your home, you feel lonely and sad, but you will get something instead of these emotions, you will be compensated with confidence and successful in your journey.",4,4,4,4,4
