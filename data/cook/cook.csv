"Fresh water has always been a limited resource in some parts of the world. Today, however, growing worldwide demand has made this a global problem.

What are the causes of the increased demand and what measure could governments and individuals take to respond to this problem?

Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.","Since time immemorial, in certain drier parts of the world, fresh water has always been a scarce natural resource. However, in the present time, due to various reasons, scarcity of fresh water has become a global issue. This essay will illustrate some factors contributing to this problem and will also elicit certain steps that can help the national authorities and individuals in controlling this growing demand for natural salt free water.

Firstly, population explosion is the factor of utmost importance, which has lead to the global surge in potable water requirement. Secondly, increased pollution of natural fresh water reserves due to urbanisation and industrialization has compounded this demand. Furthermore, in modern times, the growing use of salt free water for activities like recreational swimming, have also catalysed the surge in global water demand.

National authorities, on the other hand, can control this surge by implementing public education schemes regarding controlled water usage. Strict national legislations for preventing natural fresh water reserve pollution are also required. Moreover, government should also enact infrastructures for purification of seawater into saline free water, which will help in meeting the growing requirement of fresh water.

Similarly, public can also contribute towards this noble cause by conserving water and also by limiting their daily household water usage. They should refrain themselves from performing activities that will pollute natural fresh water reserves.

Thus even though, the scarcity of fresh water is a growing global problem, there are various means and methods available, by which both the government and individuals can prevent this from worsening. ",9,9,9,9,9
"Forests are the lungs of the earth. Destruction of the world’s forests amounts to death of the world we currently know.

To what extent do you agree or disagree?","I am in consummate accord with the statement that, the Earth’s natural green reserves purify its atmosphere and functions synonymously as that of the mammalian lungs. I also advocate the view that, forest destruction will ruin our present world.

Firstly, from our basic knowledge of plant physiology, it can be restated that, plants by the process of photosynthesis convert the harmful carbon-dioxide gas into Oxygen, without which life cannot exist.  Thus in a wider perspective, it can be stated that, the earth’s forests purify the atmosphere and thereby help in sustaining life. Secondly, environmentalists have proven that, the rapid destruction of forests is also a leading cause of global warming. Hence, destruction of the natural green reserves may lead to such a surge in the global temperature that agricultural land may become arid, leading to wide spread famine and deaths. Thirdly, forests also house diverse forms of life and these would become extinct if we continue to destroy their natural habitats.

Furthermore, scientific research have proven that forest ecosystem act as natural scavengers and by the process of biodegradation, forest ecology helps in producing crude oil, which fuels our modern world and its unavailability is unimaginable as this will directly catalyse a global economic crisis. Finally forests are also source of numerous medicinal plants, from which varieties of modern medicines are produced; Quinine, an antimalarial drug, produced from the barks of Cinchona trees is the best possible example. Hence forest destruction will also be a bane for the medical community.

Thus the harmony of the present wonderful will be ruined if our natural green reserves are continuously destroyed and there is a theoretical possibility that the blue planet might become lifeless if these green lungs are totally wiped out.",9,9,9,9,9
"The most important thing about a job is how much money you earn in that job.

Do you agree or disagree?","A vast majority of our adult life is spent working; hence it is important that we have an appropriate job that fulfils our aspirations. While financial remuneration is an important factor that attracts individuals towards a specific work, there are other factors of equal significance that make a job ideal.

Firstly, the importance of financial security cannot be undermined in the modern materialistic world. Since a vast majority of people earn their livelihood from their workplace, it will be difficult for individuals with single source of income, to make their ends meet, from underpaying jobs. Thus underpaid employees, because of their financial burdens, may not be able to offer dedication and commitment at workplace, which in turn results in under-performance. Secondly, the educated refrain from being employed in underpaying jobs, as these are less attractive. Hence the remuneration associated, is an important factor that determines the value of a particular job.

On the other hand, to glorify higher earning as the sole determiner of an ideal job is incorrect. This is because various other factors like work and life balance; working place culture and adequate recognition contribute towards satisfaction and contentment in work. Thus an astronomically higher paying job with a demanding employer, with poor social life in a tedious work place environment will lead to higher job dissatisfaction, which in turn will also promote higher attrition.

Henceforth, it can be stated that apart from financial remuneration, which is a major determiner of a good occupation, job satisfaction is also an equally important associated factor that determines the value of a specific job.",9,9,9,9,9
"Some people believe the aim of university education is to help graduates get better jobs. Others believe there are much wider benefits of university education for both individuals and society.

Discuss both views and give your opinion.","University education, even though is definitely directed towards generating lucrative employment opportunities for the advanced students; there are additional arrays of associated benefits of tertiary education that are worth mentioning.

Firstly market researches in the United States and other developed countries have shown that post graduates are able to command a considerable higher salary at workplace when compared to graduates or simple high school diploma holders. Moreover, the professional world of certain white collared highly respected professions, like those of physicians, engineers, scientists can only be pursued, after graduating from the respective university courses. Furthermore, in certain fields like management, the credibility of various universities are judged by their ability to generate glittering well-paid employment offers for their fresh graduates, during their campus placements. Hence university education is definitely perceived as a means of better employability.

In this context it is worth mentioning that, apart from generating lucrative jobs for students, universities also benefit the nation by creating educated societies, containing an immense pool of forward thinking individuals, who can contribute towards social development by their respective expertise. Individuals graduating from universities also additionally benefit from the multicultural environments that promote intercultural tolerance and brotherhood. The process of tertiary education also promotes teamwork and collective development amongst individuals. Over and above, numerous long lasting friendships, business partnerships and courtships also bloom from the university campus life.

Finally, to sum up, it can be confidently stated that apart from generating respectable employment, there are numerous associated positive aspects of university education, which are of great social and individual significance.",9,9,9,9,9
"International tourism has brought enormous benefit to many places. At the same time, there is concern about its impact on local inhabitants and the environment.

Do the disadvantages of international tourism outweigh the advantages?","Travel industry has experienced a major boom in the later part of the 20th century and has been a boon in disguise, which has helped some weaker nations to uplift their failing economies. While questions have been raised regarding the negative impacts that accompany the growth in the travel sector, these definitely do not outweigh the associated benefits.

The economic boost that accompanies a successful travel industry is quite well recognised and Thailand is the best example. The entire Thai economy revolves around tourism and the country had been able to uplift its socio economic status through its flourishing hospitality sector.  Egypt is another nation that is heavily dependent on its hospitality sector. The growth in the number of incoming tourists leads to innumerable prospects in terms of local entrepreneurship & employment generation. This is also associated with international investments and infrastructure development. The national authorities, in order to ensure safety of the international visitors provide better law and order enforcement, improved transportation and healthcare facilities, which in turn benefit the local population.

On the other hand, the rising influx of holidaymakers is associated with increased incidences of crimes, prostitution and antisocial activities like drugs, human trafficking and gambling, which affect the values of the indigenous society. The local population are also affected by the growth in property value indices. Environmentalists are also concerned regarding environmental remodelling, that is associated with increased tourist activities in natural reserves. In this context, it is worth mentioning that, by enforcing stern law and order and implementing strict legislations, governments can control most of these negative impacts of tourism.

Henceforth, it can be confidently conveyed that, even though the growth in travel industry has accompanying negative social impacts, these do not outweigh the contributions made by this sector towards social development.",9,9,9,9,9
"In the modern world, the image (photograph or film) is becoming a more powerful way of communicating than the written word.

To what extent do you agree or disagree?","In modern society, with the advent of advanced telecommunication and photographic technologies, visual expression in mediums such as television, photography and films are increasingly becoming popular as powerful means of expression when compared to the simple mundane printed medium.

The increasing preference and use of visual resources over written communication is an undeniable fact and the growing utilisation of video based learning in modern schools over text book based knowledge transfer is the best possible example. In the present evidence-seeking world, visual communication is a powerful tool as it provides recognisable facts. Meticulously crafted images, like political cartoons and television documentaries readily deliver the concerned messages to the onlookers and are mostly beneficial in conveying thoughts to the busy and uneducated sections of the society. The television is also being bombarded with numerous catchy advertisements, by which manufacturers try to communicate with the masses regarding their products.

On the other hand, the appeal of the printed media as means of mass communication, is declining as the younger generation considers it to be relatively old fashioned and boring. Moreover, in the fast paced modern city life, less number of people can afford to dedicate time for reading the daily morning newsprints, instead, most of the city dwellers follow daily-televised news. Despite this decreased appeal for mass communication, value of the written form still stands tall in the field of interpersonal and formal communication. Written words, as a form of official documentation, can never be superseded by any other means.

Thus, visual communication is definitely a popular, powerful and better tool for mass communication but written form of expression still has equal importance for official, formal and interpersonal purposes.

"In some countries young people are encouraged to work or travel for a year between finishing high school and starting university studies.

Discuss the advantages and disadvantages for young people who decide to do this.","In certain countries, it is preferred that students should take a year off from studies after completing high school, prior to joining universities and during this period they are encouraged to work or to travel. Even though this seems to be a noble concept, it has its own merits and demerits and some of these will be illustrated in this essay.

Firstly, a year off, after completing years of continuous school education is a welcome break for students and is well deserved too. This period also serves as well earned family time for those pupils who grew up within the closed boundaries of boarding schools. Secondly, this period provides ample opportunities to young people, to experience the realities of the modern world. Those students who prefer a break, can experiment with various forms of employment and thereby decide their career goals and directions depending upon their experiences. The holidaymakers, on the other hand can familiarise with the customs and cultures of various countries, which in turn will widen their outlook and will also promote cultural tolerance. Thus, in a wider perspective, such breaks help the young minds in preparing for the much demanding university life.

In contrast, certain disadvantages are definitely associated with this concept and are worth mentioning. Firstly, scholars are of the opinion that, such breaks from studies, during the learning phase of life, affects further education. According to them, such activities should not be encouraged as there are higher chances that the young minds might loose interest in learning or may get demotivated due to various reasons and might ultimately refrain from pursuing university education. Secondly, the employed youth, due to a sudden increase in their purchasing power, might also get attracted to various social evils like drugs, gambling and alcoholism.

Thus to sum up, it will be wise to comment that such policies even though are noble practices, should not be made mandatory in a national scale, as these activities are also associated with considerable negative outcome.

"The money spent by the governments on space programmes would be better spent on vital public services such as schools and hospitals. To what extent do you agree or disagree?
","In recent years, governments around the world have invested heavily in astronomical missions. While these programmes may lead to technological breakthroughs and international prestige, I firmly believe that public money should be prioritised for essential sectors like schooling and medical care. These sectors have a far more immediate and meaningful impact on citizens’ well-being.

One strong reason to support the redirection of interplanetary budgets is that schools and hospitals form the foundation of any functional society. Spending billions on extraterrestrial expeditions diverts crucial funds away from basic public soft infrastructure including education and public health. Education empowers future generations with knowledge and skills and healthcare ensures a healthy population capable of contributing to the economy. Without sufficient investment in these areas, a country risks stagnation in human development. For instance, in many low-income nations, children still study in overcrowded classrooms with few qualified teachers. According to UNESCO, improving school infrastructure and teacher training can significantly increase literacy and employment outcomes. Clearly, this kind of investment delivers immediate and long-term benefits that space programmes cannot match.

Another argument is that astronomical missions rarely address the urgent needs of the general public. Even though space explorations may offer scientific knowledge, they do not solve pressing issues such as illness, poverty, or unequal access to schooling. The majority of citizens are more concerned with access to affordable healthcare and quality schooling than with planetary exploration. Prioritising these basic provisions ensures that resources are directed toward problems that affect millions of people on a daily basis. A good example is Cuba, which has invested consistently in its public health system. Despite economic limitations, the country boasts high life expectancy and low infant mortality rates—results achieved not through advanced technology, but through consistent support for medical care. Redirecting interplanetary programme budgets could allow other nations to replicate the success.

In conclusion, although astronomical missions have their intellectual and technological merits, I strongly believe that public funds are better spent on education and medical care. These foundational pillars address the core needs of society and produce immediate, measurable improvements in people’s lives. Governments should therefore prioritise the well-being of their citizens over distant, uncertain discoveries.",8.5,8,7.0,9,9
"news editors decide what to broadcast on television and what to print in newspapers. what factors do you think influence these decisions? do we become used to bad news? would it be better if more good news was reported?
","Media outlets often find themselves in turmoil in choosing issues to present to the public. Although they consider a lot of aspects, bad accounts are usually more common to find rather than pleasant ones. This leads people to argue that a good narrative  must be delivered, or perhaps even more reported.

In detail, editors take into account various features that guarantee the audience's interest. News should have prominence, meaning consumers need to recognize the subject such as celebrities. It additionally needs to have timeliness which translates to being updated. Lastly, it must be significant, in other words, important to society. Moreover, these qualities make an event likely appealing to the public and are highly considered in decision-making regarding headlines.

While both types of narratives meet the aforementioned characteristics, editors commonly take advantage of the psychological habit of people to dwell on despicable stories or gossip. For instance, media coverage of Donald Trump's previous crime allegations during the United States elections completely overshadowed his past political achievements. Furthermore, studies show there is a human tendency to react more strongly to negative information in contrast to positive ones which subsequently leads to anxiety or mood disorders.

Nevertheless, according to another study, gratifying stories have been shown to boost dopamine levels which consequently improves mood as well as decreases depression.Therefore, it would be better to increase the number of uplifting broadcasts such as Carlos Yulo's double gold victory during the Paris Olympics which certainly makes individuals feel more elated, inspired and relieved. This is undoubtedly more beneficial than fixating on depressing topics that likely affect a person's mental well-being.

In summary, news that is intriguing, timebound and relevant highly influences broadcasting. Correspondingly, these requirements are similarly met by both horrid and optimistic journals. Unfortunately, these factors are more utilized by negative controversy due to the likelihood that people’s curiosity is more drawn by horrible events despite their psychological impacts. Despite that, mood-lightening reports should be aired more to redirect the public’s focus to healthy journalism consumption rather than a toxic one which is proportional to  optimal psychological health.

"Some people think that getting a degree from univerity is the best way to secure a good job. Others believe that employers value work experience more than a university degree. Discuss both views and give your opinion. Angsa
","It is argued that  gaining a university degree ensures  job opportunities, while others say that  work experience is more crucial to being employed. While the professional experience develops practical skills, I believe that the education provided by institutions allows us to implement deeper approaches to the subject.

On the one hand, learning skills in real life enhances the ability to do the job. Not only do apprentices acquire  essential lessons through  experimental practices with their trainers, but they also acquire the techniques of helpful methods to offer products to the public. Furthermore, it shortens the duration of the educational process and prepares labourers for the society. For example, provided statistics by Nazarbayev University show that 67% of effective employees in the vast majority of countries are those individuals, who developed their skillfulness through training in their fields.

On the other hand, what makes employers seek  graduates is their well-rounded knowledge imparted by the university. If humans are aware of all the aspects of their work, they can identify  emerging problems more easily and create important breakthroughs in their spheres. Moreover,  innovative advancements can be achieved in the case of the employment of professionals. For instance, according to a study conducted by the Ministry of Labour and Employment of Kazakhstan, 78% of experts in various fields are employed in positions related to their degrees.

In conclusion, though gaining awareness in practical labour is beneficial for becoming competent, I think that graduating from institutions with versatile education is the key to building a successful career for the majority of people.

"It is sometimes possible to pay somebody to do things you don't want to do, or don't have time to do, for example, household chores or looking after children. Is this a good way of providing work for others? Should people do these things themselves? Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.
","There is no denying that hiring someone to complete tasks can be highly beneficial for individuals and society as a whole. This essay will explore whether this practice provides job opportunities for others and whether people should manage these responsibilities themselves.

Firstly, many individuals today lead extremely busy lives, which often necessitates seeking assistance with household chores and childcare. After a long day at work, it’s common for people to feel overwhelmed by their responsibilities at home, making the option of hiring help increasingly appealing. This situation can create a substantial demand for workers in various sectors, such as cleaning and caregiving, ultimately boosting the job market. For instance, in many affluent countries, there is a reliance on workers from developing nations who provide essential services. This not only contributes to economic growth but also fosters cultural exchange and understanding among diverse communities.

On the other hand, I believe it is perfectly acceptable for individuals to delegate these tasks, especially if they possess the financial means to do so. Outsourcing chores enables people to reclaim valuable time, allowing them to focus on their careers, pursue personal interests, or spend quality time with family. Furthermore, this arrangement creates employment opportunities for those willing to work, helping them achieve financial independence. Thus, it fosters a mutually advantageous situation where both parties can benefit.

In conclusion, while opinions may vary regarding this issue, I strongly contend that hiring help can lead to significant benefits for everyone involved. It creates job opportunities while enhancing the quality of life for those who choose to seek assistance with their daily responsibilities.

"Companies invest millions of dollars in advertising to persuade consumers to buy their products. Do the advantages of this outweigh the disadvantages for the consumer?
","Organisations worldwide spend a huge sum of money on the promotion of their products to make customers buy them. Although ads inform about good-quality items, their frequent appearance can be distracting to purchasers.

On the one hand, people can become acknowledged of a high-quality product because of advertising tools. Not only do commercials offer humans better options of items they need, but they also influence consumers by providing an opportunity to learn more about new contemporary items, which promotes purchasers' standards of living by gaining stuff that facilitates their daily duties. For example, provided statistics by Nazarbayev University show that 78% of annual purchases, such as devices, clothes and food products, are made only after consumers see advertisements.

On the other hand, excessive advertisements may be considered  intrusive and distractive interference in the daily lives of viewers. Furthermore, if ads appear too frequently to the majority, they might create a negative impression and lead to a loss of trust in potential customers, instead of gaining a good reputation in front of them. For instance, according to the survey conducted by the Worldwide Marketing Researchers Institute, the average frequency of commercial appearances, which leads to  sales, is three times per week. However, the vast majority of marketing managers have exceeded this number, creating  chaos by showing ads more than 7 times per week, which results in customers' disapproval.

In conclusion, while commercials provide people with information about  beneficial manufactured goods, excessive appearances can be problematic for them. Therefore, the disadvantages for consumers outweigh the advantages of advertisements for many individuals.

"Some people think that economic growth is the most important goal for a country, while others believe that other types of progress, such as social or environmental development, are equally important. Discuss both views and give your own opinion.
","Economic growth is often regarded as the most significant goal for a nation, as it generates wealth, raises living standards, and provides funding for public services. However, others argue that social and environmental progress should be given equal priority because prosperity alone cannot ensure long-term well-being. This essay will discuss both perspectives before presenting my own view.

On the one hand, supporters of prioritising economic growth point out that a strong economy creates a solid foundation for national development. Higher GDP enables governments to invest more in healthcare, education, and infrastructure, which directly improve citizens’ quality of life. Moreover, economic growth attracts foreign investment and generates employment, reducing poverty and social inequality. For example, many Asian countries that have focused on rapid industrialisation have significantly improved living conditions for millions of people.

On the other hand, critics argue that focusing solely on economic performance can lead to serious social and environmental issues. Rapid industrialisation often comes at the expense of environmental degradation, such as air pollution, deforestation, and climate change. Furthermore, if income distribution is ignored, growth may benefit only a small elite, leaving the majority of the population disadvantaged. In this sense, social equality, healthcare, education, and environmental protection are equally crucial indicators of true progress. Without them, economic prosperity may prove unsustainable.

In my opinion, while economic development is undeniably important, it should not be the sole priority. A balanced approach that combines financial strength with social justice and environmental sustainability is essential for long-term stability. Countries that pursue growth at the expense of society or nature may achieve short-term gains but risk facing severe consequences in the future.

In conclusion, although economic growth plays a pivotal role in national progress, it should go hand in hand with social and environmental development. Only by achieving balance among these goals can nations secure sustainable prosperity for future generations.",8,8,8,7,8
"Some argue that economic progress and environmental sustainability are mutually exclusive. Discuss both viewpoints and express your opinion.
","In recent years, the question of whether countries should choose between economic growth and environmental sustainability has been widely debated. Whilst some contend that the two can coexist, others believe that they are incompatible. This essay will discuss both perspectives and explain why I support the former viewpoint.

On the one hand, I agree with those who advocate that countries can ensure economic prosperity while preserving the environment. Governments can invest in eco-friendly infrastructure, including electric vehicles, renewable energy, and recycling centres, to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and thus protect ecosystems in the long term. As a result, when people can enjoy clean air that maintains their well-being with well-maintained green spaces, it can promote eco-tourism and boost economic growth. For example, even though Singapore has invested heavily in sustainable infrastructure, where it has developed public transportation systems and recyclable products, it ranks among the top ten strongest economies.

On the other hand, opponents argue that achieving economic prosperity and preserving the environment simultaneously is a conflicting goal. They point out that rapid economic growth comes at the expense of the environment, as industrialisation can strengthen the economy and lift millions of citizens out of poverty; however, it releases an immense amount of carbon dioxide emissions into the atmosphere. For instance, China has built thousands of factories and power plants, which have successfully raised countless residents above the poverty line. Nevertheless, this swift industrial development led to severe smog, deteriorating overall public health.

To conclude, although rapid industrialisation might seem the most effective method for strengthening the economy, I am convinced that investing in clean environments can not only create a prosperous nation but also preserve the planet for future generations.",8,6,7,9,9
"There are more workers work from home ad more students studying from home. This is because computer technology is more and more accessible and cheaper. Do you think it is a positive or negative development?
","In recent years, technology has transformed the way people work. Whilst some argue that it has certain drawbacks, I firmly believe that it is a highly positive trend and will explain my opinion.

To begin with, advancements in technology have made it possible for people to study or work remotely, resulting in savings of both time and money. Remote employees and students have the ability to complete their tasks from home, which provides greater flexibility and saves time that otherwise would be wasted on commuting. For example, a 2022 study in the United States found that 67% of residents chose telecommuting over on-site work because they were stressed about traffic congestion. Moreover, since online learners and teleworkers do not need to pay for fossil fuels in order to arrive at their workplaces, they can save a large amount of money and help preserve the environment.

Furthermore, both online learning and businesses ensure accessibility for a large population. Every student can access online courses that are free of charge, which provides opportunities for disadvantaged individuals, including rural dwellers, disabled groups, and elderly adults, to learn and improve despite the barriers present in traditional learning. Similarly, citizens who live in a developing country can find high-paying jobs that match their qualifications in a developed nation. For instance, statistics from 2020 in Saudi Arabia reported that 21% of citizens were home-based workers, with salaries that exceeded twenty thousand.

To conclude, although remote working and studying may have some challenges, I am convinced that their advantages far outweigh their disadvantages. Thanks to technology, teleworking and online learning now offer wider accessibility and are more time-efficient and affordable.",8,7,7,9,9
"Some people believe that technology is making people more socially isolated, while others think it is helping people connect. Discuss both views and give your opinion.
","In recent years, technology has transformed the way people communicate. While some argue that digital tools have made socialising easier and frequent, others claim that they have reduced individuals' social skills. This essay will discuss both perspectives and explain why I support the former viewpoint.

On the one hand, I agree with those who advocate that the internet has made people more social than ever before. The advances in technology have produced numerous tools, including instant messaging apps, video call applications, and social networking platforms, all of which encourage individuals to socialise more. For example, most migrants depend on this development to keep in touch with their distant relatives, which was impossible a few decades ago. Moreover, the internet can help individuals with specific needs, such as patients with a rare condition, groups with a terminal cancer, or even the elderly, by providing access to connect and support each other, which is considered an advantage that cannot be easily achieved in real life.

On the other hand, opponents argue that technological programs are making people solitary. They point out that online platforms lack face-to-face interactions, which makes conversations less meaningful. From their perspective, many youths prefer spending time on social media and playing online games rather than meeting friends in person, which can ultimately deteriorate in-depth personal relationships. For instance, a 2020 study in the United States found that 33% of residents were addicted to social media applications, leading to an increase in the risks of feeling anxiety, depression, and loneliness. However, these problems can only occur as a result of the irresponsible use of digital online technologies.

To conclude, although there are certain social consequences of using tech tools carelessly, I am convinced that they are more effective in bringing people together.",8,7,7,8,9
"Some people think that a sense of competition in children should be encouraged. Others believe that children who are taught to co-operate rather than compete become more useful adults. Discuss both these views and give your own opinion. Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.
","Life inevitably presents individuals with adverse circumstances, whether these involve dissatisfaction at work or financial hardship. Some argue that people should simply accept such conditions, while others believe that determination and self-discipline can enable improvement. In my view, although acceptance may occasionally be unavoidable, striving to change one’s situation is usually the more empowering and productive response.

One perspective is that individuals sometimes have no option but to accept their reality. For example, in many developing nations, university graduates are forced to work in low-paid factories because widespread corruption and economic instability restrict social mobility. Even when these individuals possess the necessary skills and ambition, structural barriers prevent them from pursuing better opportunities. This proves that external systems, rather than personal effort, can decide outcomes. Consequently, acceptance may represent the most practical strategy when circumstances are shaped by factors beyond personal control.

In contrast, it is often argued that adversity can be overcome through resilience and the right mindset. A clear example is Jack Ma, who began his career as a poorly paid English teacher in China before establishing Alibaba, one of the world’s largest e-commerce companies. His success illustrates that perseverance, consistency, and vision can transform hardship into opportunity. This shows that personal qualities often play a larger role than background conditions in determining success. Thus, self-improvement is frequently attainable, provided that individuals cultivate determination and adaptability.

In conclusion, while there are cases where acceptance of hardship is unavoidable, the greater value lies in striving for improvement. By demonstrating discipline, resilience, and self-belief, people can overcome obstacles and reshape their futures. In my opinion, individuals should always attempt to enhance their circumstances, since only through effort can genuine progress be achieved.",8,8,7,8,9
"People spend more and more time browsing social networks. Is it a positive or negative development? Should anything be done to restrict children’s access to social networks? Give reasons for your answer and include any relevant examples from your own knowledge or experience.
","The two still-life paintings by Paul Cézanne and Maurice de Vlaminck represent contrasting approaches to art, despite focusing on similar subject matter. While both artists explored the genre of still life, their styles reveal two distinct artistic movements that shaped modern art history.

Overall, Cézanne’s Still Life with Fruit demonstrates features of late Impressionism, whereas Vlaminck’s Still Life with Bottles embodies Fauvism, a radical style that was controversial in its time. These works highlight the shift in European art during the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, when painters sought to challenge the dominance of classical traditions and redefine aesthetic values.

Cézanne’s painting is characterised by visible yet controlled brushstrokes, an open composition, and careful attention to the play of light. The shading is fully developed, capturing subtle tonal variations that create depth and emphasise realism. Such qualities reflect the Impressionist concern with depicting natural light and atmosphere as accurately as possible. In contrast, Vlaminck rejected these conventions in pursuit of expressive freedom. His bottle composition shows incomplete and flat shadows with no smooth gradient, while the perspective of the objects appears inconsistent, as if intentionally distorted. As a result, the ceramic pieces resemble paper cut-outs decorated with patterns, whereas the glass bottles retain more conventional form.

Another notable difference lies in the treatment of colour. Cézanne employed a soft palette and a pale background, which enhanced the natural appearance of the fruit and interior space. Vlaminck, however, relied on high vibrancy, sharp contrasts, and strong lighting with little transition between tones. This bold use of colour is a hallmark of Fauvism, where expressive intensity was valued above representational accuracy.

In conclusion, although Cézanne and Vlaminck both painted still-life subjects, their works illustrate the fundamental divide between Impressionism and Fauvism.Together, these paintings demonstrate the diversity of artistic responses during a transformative period in European art

"Some people think that men and women hav different qualities, therefore certain jobs are suitable for meen and others for women. To what extent do you agree or disagree?
","In contemporary society, gender equality has become a central discussion point, particularly regarding employment opportunities. While it is true that men and women may differ in certain biological or psychological aspects, I strongly disagree with the notion that specific jobs should be reserved for one gender. Instead, I believe that suitability for a job depends more on individual ability and training than on gender differences.

Admittedly, men and women are not identical in physical attributes. For example, men generally possess greater muscle mass, which may provide an advantage in physically demanding roles such as heavy construction or firefighting. However, technological advancements and improved workplace practices have significantly reduced the need for sheer physical strength. Modern equipment, safety protocols, and collaborative work environments enable women to perform these jobs effectively, as demonstrated by the growing number of female soldiers, engineers, and first responders.

Beyond physical strength, the assumption that men are inherently more logical or that women are naturally more emotional oversimplifies human capabilities. Many studies suggest that both genders can excel in fields requiring analytical reasoning, creativity, or emotional intelligence, depending on education and personal temperament. For instance, women have proven themselves as successful leaders and executives, while men have thrived in professions traditionally associated with empathy and care, such as nursing and teaching. These examples highlight that qualities are not determined by gender but shaped by experience and opportunity.

In conclusion, although men and women may exhibit some natural differences, restricting jobs based on gender is neither fair nor practical. In the modern workforce, individual talent, training, and motivation are far more important than biological distinctions. Therefore, all people should be encouraged to pursue careers aligned with their skills and interests, regardless of gender.",7.5,7,6,7,9
"The family has a great influence on children development but the influence from outside the home play bigger part in children's likes. do you agree or disagree
","It is often argued that children are shaped not only by their families but also by wider social influences. In my view, both factors play crucial roles, but their impact may be stronger at different stages of a child’s life.

To begin with, the family provides the first and most lasting influence on children’s development. Parents act as role models, and youngsters usually adopt their attitudes, values, and manners through daily interaction at home. For example, respect for others or a strong work ethic is usually instilled by parents long before children enter school. In addition, a supportive family environment gives children emotional security and confidence, which are essential for healthy growth. Without this foundation, many children struggle to form stable relationships or cope with difficulties later in life.

On the other hand, external influences become increasingly significant as children grow older. One powerful factor is peer groups. Friends often shape children’s likes and dislikes, from the music they listen to, to the clothes they wear, and even the decisions they make about study or leisure. Another key influence is the media, including social networks, films, and advertisements. These channels create powerful images of success and lifestyle, which children may try to imitate, sometimes even more eagerly than following parental guidance.

In conclusion, the family plays an essential role in providing values and emotional stability, while outside influences such as peers and media strongly affect children’s interests and choices. Therefore, I believe both sources of influence are important, but their impact varies depending on the stage of development.",7.5,6,7,7,9
"Some think that governments should tax unhealthy food to encourage people to eat healthier. To what extent do you agree or disagree?
","Many people argue that if governments introduce higher taxes on fast food, the number of consumers will decline. I completely agree with this view, as making junk food more expensive would reduce its popularity and lead to healthier lifestyles in society.

Firstly, fast food is one of the leading causes of obesity and other health issues. Preparing fresh and nutritious meals requires time and effort, whereas junk food is cheap, quick, and easily accessible. However, these products usually contain excessive amounts of fat, sugar, and artificial ingredients, offering little to no nutritional value and harming overall well-being. For instance, in the United States, obesity rates are highest in areas where fast food is widely consumed and affordable. By imposing higher taxes, governments can discourage frequent purchases and encourage people to cook at home or choose healthier alternatives.

Secondly, additional taxation can especially benefit younger generations, who are the main consumers of fast food. Teenagers often prefer pizza, fried chicken, or sugary drinks when meeting with friends, largely because such options are inexpensive. Unfortunately, regular consumption of these items increases the risk of diabetes and heart disease later in life. Evidence from the United Kingdom shows that after the introduction of the “sugar tax” in 2018, sales of high-sugar drinks dropped, and many companies reformulated their products with less sugar. This demonstrates that raising prices through taxation can effectively change eating habits and protect public health.

In conclusion, I strongly support the idea that governments should make junk food more expensive. By reducing its affordability, authorities can help people adopt healthier diets and improve overall quality of life in society.",7.5,7,7,7,8
"As well as making money, businesses also have social responsibilities. To what extent do you agree or disagree?
","t is generally accepted that the main reason many people decide to start a business is to generate massive income. However, some argue that businesses should regard social responsibilities as equally important as profit. I totally agree with this view, since businesses directly affect both people and the environment.

First and foremost, companies must consider consumers before distributing products. This is mostly because their goods affect people's lives by influencing their health, nutrition, and overall quality of life. For example, about 72% of people worldwide rely on company-produced food such as milk, rice, and bottled water to meet their daily needs. Therefore, firms should undergo rigorous processes before launching their products to ensure that the food is safe and suitable for consumption, particularly in terms of public well-being.

Furthermore, businesses also release pollution that impacts local communities. When companies ignore this issue and focus merely on profits, local communities inevitably suffer. For instance, PT. Tjiwi Kimia, a paper producer located near residential areas, has been criticised for contaminating local water supplies. Consequently, the company decided to provide free clean water for residents as a part of its corporate social responsibility. Such actions are a reasonable step to mitigate the harm they have caused.

In conclusion, social responsibilities are indeed a major concern for all business sectors, particularly in relation to consumer safety and environmental protection, which should be given the same priority as making money. I firmly believe that these duties are essential aspects of modern business practice, whether they are carried out by small or large companies.",7.5,6,6,8,9
