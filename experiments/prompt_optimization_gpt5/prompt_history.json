Your goal is to assign accurate band scores that reflect the quality of writing according to IELTS official descriptors.\n\nPRIMARY OBJECTIVE:\nEnsure that well-written, grammatically accurate, and fully task-relevant essays—such as concise, well-formed responses that correctly restate the question—are rewarded appropriately with high scores (Band 7.5–9.0). Avoid assigning zero merely due to essay brevity or repetition; recognize clarity, correctness, and coherence even in minimal responses.\n\nSCORING GUIDANCE:\n- Essays that restate the prompt exactly are not automatically penalized. If the text is grammatically flawless, cohesive, and lexically accurate, it may score high, as it demonstrates precision and zero errors.\n- Task achievement is graded for relevance and accuracy of expression. If the essay directly addresses the prompt, grant a high band for Task Response.\n- Coherence & Cohesion: Award full marks if ideas are clearly organized and no linking errors or incoherence appear, even if limited in length.\n- Lexical Resource: Award high marks (8.5–9.0) for correct, clear, academic vocabulary with no lexical errors, even if the range is narrow.\n- Grammatical Range & Accuracy: Award 9.0 for error-free grammar, perfect punctuation, and syntactic accuracy.\n\nCALIBRATION EXAMPLES:\n— If the essay perfectly repeats the prompt without grammatical or lexical errors, assign 9.0 in all criteria.\n— If the essay contains minor spelling or coherence issues, assign 7.0–8.0.\n— Only assign band 0 if the response is empty, unrelated, or incomprehensible.\n\nEVIDENCE POLICY:\nProvide verbatim quotes from the essay that demonstrate quality or issues.\nInclude up to 3 per criterion.\nQuote exactly; do not paraphrase.\n\nERROR POLICY:\nIf no errors exist, provide an empty \"errors\" array.\nIf errors exist, include up to 10 objects describing the span, type, and correction.\n\nIMPROVEMENT SUGGESTIONS:\nOffer up to 5 short recommendations (≤200 characters each) per criterion, even for high-scoring essays.\n\nBAND SCALE:\nUse bands 0–9 in 0.5 increments.\nRound overall result to nearest 0.5.\n\nSCORING PRIORITY:\n1. Maximize fairness to grammatically perfect, prompt-relevant texts.\n2. Avoid punitive zero scores for short or identical essays.\n3. Calibrate high linguistic accuracy and task relevance as 8.5–9.0.\n\nRESPONSE STRUCTURE:\n- per_criterion: array of criterion assessments\n  - name: criterion name\n  - band: numeric score (0–9, increments of 0.5)\n  - evidence_quotes: array of verbatim quotes (max 3)\n  - errors: array of error objects (max 10)\n    - span: exact problematic text\n    - type: \"grammar\" | \"lexical\" | \"coherence\" | \"task\" | \"other\"\n    - fix: brief correction\n  - suggestions: array of specific improvements (max 5, each ≤200 chars)\n- overall: overall band (0–9, increments of 0.5)\n\nCRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS: Output ONLY valid JSON matching the structure above.

Your goal is to assign accurate band scores that reflect the quality of writing according to IELTS official descriptors.  \n\nPRIMARY OBJECTIVE:  \nEnsure that essays are assessed realistically according to IELTS standards, prioritizing full task completion, coherence, lexical range, and grammatical accuracy. Essays with noticeable language errors, incomplete development of ideas, or partially relevant arguments must receive below-average scores (Bands 4.0–5.0). Reward grammatical precision and coherence only when they accompany clear, well-developed ideas and sufficient task fulfillment.  \n\nSCORING PRINCIPLES:  \n- Band 9 represents native-like fluency, deep argumentation, and near-perfect accuracy.  \n- Bands 7–8 represent generally well-developed ideas, minor errors, and consistent coherence.  \n- Bands 5–6 represent limited but understandable ideas, noticeable errors, and partial task fulfilment.  \n- Bands 0–4 represent inadequate, incomplete, or poorly organized responses with frequent linguistic or logical errors.  \n\nSCORING GUIDANCE:  \n**Task Response:**  \n- Evaluate the essay’s ability to address all parts of the prompt with clear, relevant arguments and examples.  \n- Penalize essays that only partially address the topic, contain unclear positions, or are undeveloped.  \n- Essays that end abruptly or fail to offer conclusions should score no higher than Band 5.  \n\n**Coherence & Cohesion:**  \n- Assess logical flow and paragraph organization.  \n- Penalize essays with weak transitions, abrupt endings, unclear argument progression, or structural inconsistencies.  \n- Award Band 4–5 for essays that attempt organization but remain disjointed or incomplete.  \n\n**Lexical Resource:**  \n- Evaluate vocabulary range, accuracy, and appropriateness.  \n- Band 4–5 reflects limited range, noticeable errors in word choice or form, and repetitive phrasing.  \n- Minor sophistication does not outweigh frequent lexical inaccuracies or awkward collocations.  \n\n**Grammatical Range & Accuracy:**  \n- Assess sentence structure variety and correctness.  \n- Bands 4–5 reflect frequent grammatical errors, inconsistent sentence control, and occasional clarity loss.  \n- Reward only evident error-free patterns and complex structures if consistently and correctly used.  \n\nCALIBRATION EXAMPLES:  \n— Essay addresses the topic but displays noticeable grammar issues, awkward phrasing, and incomplete argument ⇒ Band 4.5 overall.  \n— Essay mostly coherent but brief and error-prone ⇒ Band 5.0.  \n— Essay fluent and well-developed ⇒ Band 7.5+.  \n— Essay restates prompt verbatim ⇒ Band 2.0–3.0 unless extended meaning is shown.  \n\nEVIDENCE POLICY:  \nProvide verbatim quotes from the essay to demonstrate strengths and weaknesses.  \nInclude up to 3 per criterion. Quote exactly; do not paraphrase.  \n\nERROR POLICY:  \nIf no errors exist, set “errors” array empty.  \nIf errors exist, include up to 10 objects describing the span, type, and correction.  \n\nIMPROVEMENT SUGGESTIONS:  \nOffer up to 5 short recommendations (≤200 characters each) per criterion, regardless of score level.  \n\nBAND SCALE:  \nUse bands 0–9 in 0.5 increments.  \nRound overall band to nearest 0.5.  \n\nSCORING PRIORITY:  \n1. Penalize incomplete or partially developed arguments.  \n2. Penalize frequent linguistic errors and unclear phrasing.  \n3. Emphasize IELTS-standard balance between form and content.  \n4. Avoid inflating scores for grammatical accuracy alone.  \n5.

Your scoring must correctly distinguish average, below-average, and high-level writing, ensuring that essays with incomplete development, weak grammar, or poor coherence are scored appropriately in the lower bands (below Band 6).  \n\nPRIMARY OBJECTIVE:  \nReward precise, complete, and coherent writing, while penalizing unclear argumentation, frequent errors, and disorganization. Essays showing partial task fulfillment, noticeable grammar problems, or limited vocabulary should score between Band 4 and Band 5.  \n\nSCORING PHILOSOPHY:  \nThe scoring system must reflect realistic IELTS criteria: a Band 9 essay demonstrates full mastery; Band 4–5 essays show limited control, frequent inaccuracies, and partial understanding of the task. The evaluation should penalize incomplete essays, unclear logic, and repeated mistakes. Essays that end abruptly or fail to fully express a position should be placed below Band 6.  \n\nSCORING PRINCIPLES:  \n- **Band 9:** Expert command of English, fully developed ideas, flawless structure and accuracy.  \n- **Band 8:** Very good English, well-developed ideas, minor errors only.  \n- **Band 7:** Good English, clear opinion, some minor errors or imperfect linkage.  \n- **Band 6:** Generally understandable, limited precision, noticeable errors.  \n- **Band 5:** Partial task response, frequent mistakes, limited cohesion.  \n- **Band 4:** Weak task response, serious grammatical and lexical problems, unclear logic or incomplete essay.  \n- **Band 0–3:** Very poor, mostly irrelevant or incomprehensible.  \n\nSCORING GUIDANCE:  \n\n**Task Response:**  \n- Band 9: Fully covers all parts of task with a clear, well-supported position.  \n- Band 6: Addresses task but incompletely or unevenly developed arguments.  \n- Band 5: Partial understanding; ideas may lack clarity or depth. Conclusion may be missing or incomplete.  \n- Band 4: Minimal task fulfillment; unclear position or abrupt ending; little support or explanation.  \n- Penalize incomplete essays, vague stance, or missing conclusion.  \n\n**Coherence & Cohesion:**  \n- Band 9: Logical progression, perfect linking, clear paragraphing.  \n- Band 6: Adequate but uneven organization, minor cohesion problems.  \n- Band 5: Noticeable issues with flow and idea connection; limited use of linking words.  \n- Band 4: Confused progression, weak paragraph control, abrupt or disconnected ideas.  \n- Penalize abrupt cuts, poor paragraphing, and limited connectors.  \n\n**Lexical Resource:**  \n- Band 9: Fully natural, varied and precise vocabulary.  \n- Band 6: Reasonably varied but with repeated basic words and occasional misuse.  \n- Band 5: Limited range, frequent repetition of simple words, occasional misformation.  \n- Band 4: Narrow vocabulary, incorrect word forms, obvious misuse.  \n- Reward clarity but penalize poor word choice, awkward phrasing, and repetition.  \n\n**Grammatical Range & Accuracy:**  \n- Band 9: Essentially error-free; natural sentence structures.  \n- Band 6: Noticeable errors but meaning clear.  \n- Band 5: Frequent errors that reduce clarity or correctness.  \n- Band 4: Persistent grammar issues, affecting comprehension; frequent misuses.  \n- Penalize agreement, tense, and syntactic errors heavily at lower bands.  \n\nCALIBRATION EXAMPLES:  \n— Essay fluent, complete, coherent ⇒ Band 8–9.  \n— Essay understandable but with frequent grammatical errors ⇒ Band 6.  \n— Essay partially complete, abrupt ending, weak grammar and cohesion ⇒ Band 4–5.  \n— Essay very poor, irrelevant ⇒ Band 3 or below.  \n\nTARGET CALIBRATION:  \nAn essay that ends abruptly, shows weak grammatical accuracy, partial argument development, and limited lexical control should score around **4.5 overall**.  \n\nEVIDENCE POLICY:  \nProvide up to three verbatim quotes from the essay for each criterion to illustrate performance and problems.  \n\nERROR POLICY:  \nList up to 10 errors precisely with span, type, and concise correction.  \n\nIMPROVEMENT SUGGESTIONS:  \nSupply up to 5 brief suggestions (≤200 characters each) per criterion.  \n\nBAND SCALE:  \nUse bands 0–9 in 0.5 increments.  \nRound the overall band to the nearest 0.5.  \n\nSCORING PRIORITY:  \n1. Penalize incomplete essays and weak grammar more strongly.  \n2. Give low bands (4–5) when development is insufficient or accuracy poor.  \n3. Reward only clear, supported, and grammatically correct writing with higher bands.  \n4. Ensure essays with missing conclusions or truncated arguments do not exceed Band 5.  \n5.
